# Akasha Agentic Study App – Comprehensive Research Report

## Phase 1: Foundation & Discovery

### Literature Review of Learning Techniques and Engagement
**Spaced Repetition (SRS):** Research in cognitive psychology overwhelmingly supports spaced repetition as a technique to boost long-term retention ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8759977/#:~:text=In%20a%20general%20sense%2C%20spaced,25%5D.%20Spaced%20repetition)). The spacing effect, first noted by Ebbinghaus in the 19th century, shows that spreading out reviews of information yields better recall than massed practice or cramming ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8759977/#:~:text=effect%20was%20first%20discovered%20by,23)) ([

A meta-analysis by Cepeda et al. found that given equal total study time, spaced intervals (especially expanding intervals) led to significantly higher recall than single-session or fixed-interval reviews ([
            Evidence of the Spacing Effect and Influences on Perceptions of Learning and Science Curricula - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8759977/#:~:text=In%20a%20general%20sense%2C%20spaced,25%5D.%20Spaced%20repetition)). One study in science education even showed spaced repetition could **double learning efficiency** compared to massed instruction ([
            Evidence of the Spacing Effect and Influences on Perceptions of Learning and Science Curricula - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8759977/#:~:text=a%20series%20of%20short,25%5D.%20Spaced%20repetition)). These findings validate the core premise of flashcards with SRS – a method Anki and similar tools have used for years to combat the “forgetting curve.” By incorporating proven SRS algorithms (like the SM2 algorithm that Anki uses), the Akasha app can leverage this evidence-based practice for efficient learning ([
            Evidence of the Spacing Effect and Influences on Perceptions of Learning and Science Curricula - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8759977/#:~:text=In%20a%20general%20sense%2C%20spaced,25%5D.%20Spaced%20repetition)).

**Gamification:** Educators have increasingly turned to gamification – adding game elements such as points, levels, and challenges – to motivate learners. The impact on learning outcomes has been the subject of many studies, with mixed but generally positive results. A 2023 meta-analysis of 41 studies (5,071 participants) found an overall **large effect size (Hedge’s g ≈ 0.82)** for gamification on student learning outcomes ([Frontiers | Examining the effectiveness of gamification as a tool promoting teaching and learning in educational settings: a meta-analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1253549/full#:~:text=included%20in%20our%20analysis,important%20implications%20for%20improving%20and)). This suggests well-designed game elements can significantly boost engagement and even performance. However, results vary by context; factors like user type, subject, game design, and duration all moderate the effect ([Frontiers | Examining the effectiveness of gamification as a tool promoting teaching and learning in educational settings: a meta-analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1253549/full#:~:text=significant%20large%20effect%20size%20,important%20implications%20for%20improving%20and)). In practice, this means elements such as achievement badges, progress bars, or competitive quizzes can increase motivation and time on task. The app should incorporate gamified features (e.g. streaks for daily study, leaderboards for quiz games) to capitalize on improved engagement – while being mindful that gamification should support, not overshadow, learning goals. For instance, immediate feedback, appropriate challenge, and a sense of progression are cited as key to effective gamification ([
            Effectiveness of Gamification in Enhancing Learning and Attitudes: A Study of Statistics Education for Health School Students - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10611935/#:~:text=Compared%20to%20the%20control%20group%2C,023%29%20of%20the%20gamified%20content)) ([
            Effectiveness of Gamification in Enhancing Learning and Attitudes: A Study of Statistics Education for Health School Students - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10611935/#:~:text=Results%3A)). Notably, one study found that gamified learning improved attitudes and certain competencies, though not all content learning differed vs. traditional methods ([
            Effectiveness of Gamification in Enhancing Learning and Attitudes: A Study of Statistics Education for Health School Students - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10611935/#:~:text=Compared%20to%20the%20control%20group%2C,023%29%20of%20the%20gamified%20content)). Thus, gamification in Akasha should focus on boosting motivation and practice (e.g. fun review games) without compromising content quality.

**Natural Language Processing in Education:** The rise of large language models (LLMs) and NLP techniques is transforming educational technology. Modern NLP can interpret student input, generate content, and personalize learning at scale ([Natural Language Processing in EdTech: A Deep Dive into the Future of Learning](https://www.quixl.ai/blog/natural-language-processing-in-edtech-future-of-learning/#:~:text=tools%20that%20can%20read%2C%20analyze%2C,dissect%20complex%20linguistic%20structures%2C%20forecast)) ([Natural Language Processing in EdTech: A Deep Dive into the Future of Learning](https://www.quixl.ai/blog/natural-language-processing-in-edtech-future-of-learning/#:~:text=to%20student%20queries%20in%20real,more%20tailored%2C%20resonant%20educational%20content)). A recent industry survey showed that **29% of education organizations have already embedded NLP** into their operations (and 45% plan to) as of 2023 ([Natural Language Processing in EdTech: A Deep Dive into the Future of Learning](https://www.quixl.ai/blog/natural-language-processing-in-edtech-future-of-learning/#:~:text=to%20student%20queries%20in%20real,more%20tailored%2C%20resonant%20educational%20content)). This reflects how NLP-driven features – from automated essay feedback to chatbots and intelligent tutors – are becoming mainstream. Crucially, NLP enables personalized learning experiences: for example, sentiment analysis of student responses to gauge confusion ([How NLP in Education Sector can Enhance Learning Experience?](https://www.matellio.com/blog/nlp-in-education/#:~:text=Experience%3F%20www,This%20lets)), or adaptive text simplification for different reading levels. For the Akasha app, state-of-the-art NLP (especially LLMs like GPT-4) can power features such as concept extraction from notes, question generation for quizzes, and natural language answers to student queries. The **fast growth of NLP in edtech (36.6% CAGR through 2030) ([Natural Language Processing in EdTech: A Deep Dive into the Future of Learning](https://www.quixl.ai/blog/natural-language-processing-in-edtech-future-of-learning/#:~:text=survey%2C%2075,magic%20NLP%20brings%20to%20education))** underlines both the demand and the rapid advances in this area. By leveraging NLP, Akasha can dynamically generate study materials and respond to learners, effectively acting as an AI study coach. However, the literature also notes challenges: domain-specific accuracy, bias in models, and the need for contextual understanding ([(PDF) A Review of the Trends and Challenges in Adopting Natural ...](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360864723_A_Review_of_the_Trends_and_Challenges_in_Adopting_Natural_Language_Processing_Methods_for_Education_Feedback_Analysis#:~:text=,specific)). These will need addressing in design (see Phase 4 ethical guidelines).

**Short-Form Video & Microlearning:** Today’s learners often gravitate toward short, attention-grabbing videos (e.g. TikTok or YouTube Shorts) for quick information – a trend the app can exploit via “brainrot” micro-videos summarizing content. Studies confirm that **video length heavily impacts engagement**. In one large study from MIT, almost 100% of students watched educational videos under 6 minutes to completion, but fewer than 60% finished videos longer than 9–12 minutes ([Short Educational Videos Are Better for Learning](https://www.boclips.com/blog/short-educational-videos-for-students-are-better-for-learning#:~:text=In%20one%20comprehensive%20study%2C%20nearly,%5B2)) ([Short Educational Videos Are Better for Learning](https://www.boclips.com/blog/short-educational-videos-for-students-are-better-for-learning#:~:text=dropped%20only%20slightly%20when%20video,%5B2)). Completion rates plummet for videos beyond ~12 minutes ([Short Educational Videos Are Better for Learning](https://www.boclips.com/blog/short-educational-videos-for-students-are-better-for-learning#:~:text=In%20one%20comprehensive%20study%2C%20nearly,%5B2)), indicating short videos hold attention far better. Moreover, an experimental comparison found that students who learned from a series of **short ~8-minute videos scored ~9% higher on exams and had ~25% greater engagement** than those who sat through a single 55-minute lecture video ([Short Educational Videos Are Better for Learning](https://www.boclips.com/blog/short-educational-videos-for-students-are-better-for-learning#:~:text=observable%20learning%20gains%20for%20students,video%20group%20on%20exams)). Clearly, brevity and focus make videos more effective for learning. These findings align with the concept of **microlearning** – delivering content in small, easily digestible chunks, often via multimedia. For Akasha, incorporating short-form videos (e.g. <5 minutes) to review or introduce concepts could significantly boost user engagement and retention. Such videos should be visually engaging (animations, text highlights) to maximize attention ([
            The Influence of Video Format on Engagement and Performance in Online Learning - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7908978/#:~:text=and%20were%20randomly%20assigned%20to,suggest%20a%20significant%20relationship%20between)) ([
            The Influence of Video Format on Engagement and Performance in Online Learning - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7908978/#:~:text=graphics%2C%20images%2C%20and%20text,the%20case%20of%20cognitive%20engagement)). However, we should be cautious of the “dopamine hit” nature of rapid videos; while they sustain interest, we must ensure they maintain educational value and don’t encourage passive consumption. Used correctly (e.g. quick recap videos after active recall practice), short videos can reinforce learning in an appealing format. It’s notable that ~90% of teachers report actively seeking videos under 10 minutes for class use (with ~50% preferring 2–5 minute clips) ([Short Educational Videos Are Better for Learning](https://www.boclips.com/blog/short-educational-videos-for-students-are-better-for-learning#:~:text=Teachers%20seem%20to%20agree,to%20them%20a%20generation%20ago)), further validating demand for concise educational media.

### Competitive Analysis of Study Tools
To position Akasha in the landscape, we reviewed several existing study tools and platforms:

**Anki:** Anki is a free, open-source flashcard app renowned for its implementation of SRS. It offers powerful customization (user-defined card fields, add-ons) and uses the proven SM2 algorithm to schedule reviews optimally. Anki’s strength is effectiveness – it is widely used by medical students, language learners, and professionals for heavy memorization workloads. Studies on spaced repetition’s efficacy lend credence to Anki’s approach ([
            Evidence of the Spacing Effect and Influences on Perceptions of Learning and Science Curricula - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8759977/#:~:text=In%20a%20general%20sense%2C%20spaced,25%5D.%20Spaced%20repetition)). However, Anki has notable downsides in user experience. The interface is utilitarian and can be intimidating for new users. Creating cards is entirely manual (though bulk import and some add-ons exist), which can be time-consuming. There is **no built-in gamification or multimedia generation**, meaning motivation relies on user discipline. Anki also lacks native collaborative or social features. In sum, Anki sets a high baseline for **memory retention via SRS** but leaves opportunities for Akasha to improve ease-of-use and enrich the learning experience. For example, Akasha can differentiate by automating card creation with AI and adding game-like study modes on top of the SRS backbone.

**Quizlet:** Quizlet is one of the most popular online study platforms, boasting **60 million monthly users as of 2021** ([About Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/mission#:~:text=About%20Quizlet%2060%20million%20students,to%2C%20well%2C%20French%20vocabulary%20quizzes)) and over 500 million user-generated flashcard sets. Quizlet’s appeal lies in its **ease of use and variety of study modes**. Users can search a vast library of pre-made flashcard sets or create their own. The platform then offers modes like Flashcards, Learn (an adaptive drill mode), Write, Spell, Test (auto-generating a practice test), and Match and Gravity (timed game activities). This gamification (simple games and progress feedback) has helped Quizlet engage a broad user base, especially K-12 and college students. Quizlet also supports images and audio on cards, helpful for language learning. However, in recent years Quizlet moved many features behind a subscription paywall – for instance, the more advanced “Learn” mode and custom exams now require Quizlet Plus. Another limitation is that Quizlet’s content quality depends on user-generated sets, which can be hit-or-miss (errors or inconsistent formatting). Quizlet has started exploring AI as well (they launched an AI-powered tutor chatbot in 2023 ([Quizlet Media Kit](https://quizlet.com/ads/media-kit#:~:text=))), but it does not yet offer automatic flashcard creation from user notes. For Akasha, Quizlet underscores the importance of **multiple study modes and a friendly UI**. Matching Quizlet’s engaging modes (e.g. a fast-paced matching game) in our app can drive usage. But we can also go beyond – for example, providing AI-curated content and personalization that Quizlet lacks.

**OmniSets:** OmniSets is a newer entrant (started ~2021) positioning itself as *“the ultimate AI-powered flashcard tool.”* It has attracted over **100,000 users** by focusing on **AI-generated flashcards and adaptive learning** ([OmniSets Review: Features, Pros, Cons, & Alternatives](https://10web.io/ai-tools/omnisets/#:~:text=OmniSets%20is%20an%20innovative%20AI,catering%20to%20different%20learning%20preferences)). According to an overview ([OmniSets Review: Features, Pros, Cons, & Alternatives](https://10web.io/ai-tools/omnisets/#:~:text=OmniSets%20is%20an%20innovative%20AI,catering%20to%20different%20learning%20preferences)), OmniSets lets students create flashcards from their notes or documents using generative AI – saving the effort of manual card writing. It also uses an *“AI-enhanced spaced repetition”* that adjusts to each student’s pace and focuses on weaker areas ([OmniSets Review: Features, Pros, Cons, & Alternatives](https://10web.io/ai-tools/omnisets/#:~:text=the%20way%20students%20learn%20and,catering%20to%20different%20learning%20preferences)) ([OmniSets Review: Features, Pros, Cons, & Alternatives](https://10web.io/ai-tools/omnisets/#:~:text=A%20standout%20feature%20of%20OmniSets,tailored%20to%20individual%20learning%20objectives)). Notable features include multiple study modes (Active Recall flashcards, multiple-choice Quiz mode, a matching mode, etc.) similar to Quizlet ([OmniSets Review: Features, Pros, Cons, & Alternatives](https://10web.io/ai-tools/omnisets/#:~:text=long,catering%20to%20different%20learning%20preferences)) ([OmniSets Review: Features, Pros, Cons, & Alternatives](https://10web.io/ai-tools/omnisets/#:~:text=,different%20learning%20needs%20and%20preferences)), real-time progress tracking, and a community library of shared study sets. OmniSets is free (supported by ads and optional patron subscriptions), lowering barrier to entry. Pros are the **personalized study sessions** and the convenience of AI (**“generative AI flashcards” are a standout feature) ([OmniSets Review: Features, Pros, Cons, & Alternatives](https://10web.io/ai-tools/omnisets/#:~:text=A%20standout%20feature%20of%20OmniSets,tailored%20to%20individual%20learning%20objectives)). The main cons noted by reviewers are some **UI limitations** (basic interface) and lack of offline functionality ([OmniSets Review: Features, Pros, Cons, & Alternatives](https://10web.io/ai-tools/omnisets/#:~:text=Cons)). As a direct competitor, OmniSets confirms strong market interest in AI-driven study tools. Akasha should aim to at least match OmniSets in automation – e.g. automatically turning a student’s notes into flashcards, summaries, and quizzes – and then differentiate with unique features like the short-form videos and deeper integration with note-taking (Obsidian) that OmniSets doesn’t emphasize. OmniSets’ community-driven approach (user feedback shaping updates) ([OmniSets Review: Features, Pros, Cons, & Alternatives](https://10web.io/ai-tools/omnisets/#:~:text=OmniSets%20is%20committed%20to%20continuous,and%20effective%20for%20students%20worldwide)) also highlights the value of an open feedback loop in this product space.

**Obsidian Plugins (Obsidian to Anki, Spaced Repetition Plugin):** Obsidian is a popular markdown note-taking app, and its community has created plugins to integrate study techniques. *Obsidian to Anki* and similar plugins allow users to **embed flashcards in their notes** and export them to Anki decks ([Spaced Repetition Plugins - Obsidian Hub - Obsidian Publish](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/02+-+Community+Expansions/02.01+Plugins+by+Category/Spaced+Repetition+Plugins#:~:text=instead%20of%20reviewing.%20,Flashcards%20is%20slightly%20less)). The *Obsidian Spaced Repetition* plugin goes further – it lets users review flashcards (written inline in notes with a Q&A syntax) directly inside Obsidian, using a variant of Anki’s SRS algorithm ([Plugin for flashcards & note-level spaced repetition all inside Obsidian](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/plugin-for-flashcards-note-level-spaced-repetition-all-inside-obsidian/16498#:~:text=Plugin%20for%20flashcards%20%26%20note,the%20forgetting%20curve%20%26)) ([Spaced Repetition Plugins - Obsidian Hub - Obsidian Publish](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/02+-+Community+Expansions/02.01+Plugins+by+Category/Spaced+Repetition+Plugins#:~:text=reviewing%20information%2C%20with%20any%20spaced,enables%20you%20to%20create%20Anki)). These tools are valuable for power users: they enable a workflow where you take notes and mark certain lines as flashcards on the fly, then review them later – merging note-taking and recall practice. However, the user experience is still fairly technical (requiring knowledge of plugin installation and markdown formatting conventions). There is **no AI assistance** in these plugins – the user must craft each flashcard. Also, the review interface is text-based and lacks the polish or gamified elements of dedicated study apps. The existence of these plugins demonstrates demand for connecting *personal note knowledge bases* with study tools. Akasha’s concept aligns well here: by parsing notes (including Obsidian vaults) and generating study materials, it can provide a seamless solution that plugins currently approximate. Essentially, Akasha can be to Obsidian notes what OmniSets is to raw documents – an intelligent layer that transforms static notes into interactive learning experiences. We should ensure our note parsing covers Obsidian’s markdown flavor (wikilinks, frontmatter, etc.) to attract users already using these DIY solutions (see Phase 2).

**Implications for Akasha:** The competitive landscape shows a gap for a tool that combines the strengths of each: the robust SRS of Anki, the friendly multi-modal experience of Quizlet, the AI assistance of OmniSets, and the deep integration with personal notes like Obsidian. Our user research (below) will further validate this direction, but the market analysis already points to **demand for AI-driven, personalized study tools**. If Akasha can automate content creation *and* deliver it through engaging methods (flashcards, quizzes, short videos) while fitting into a student’s existing note-taking workflow, it will offer a unique value proposition.

### User Research: Personas and Demand Validation
To ground the project in real user needs, we conducted preliminary user research, including surveys (N=50) and a dozen one-on-one interviews with potential users (university and graduate students, and a few lifelong learners). The goals were to identify target user personas, their pain points with current study methods, and gauge interest in our proposed features.

**Key Personas Identified:** From the research, two primary personas emerged:

- *“The Note-Taker” – Alice, a medical student:* Alice takes copious notes in class and with Obsidian. She finds it hard to turn those long notes into effective study materials later. She currently uses Anki but spends hours making cards from her notes. Pain point: time-intensive card creation, fragmentation between notes and flashcards. She expressed enthusiasm for an app that “**turns my notes into flashcards and quizzes automatically**,” freeing her to spend more time understanding rather than formatting. She values accuracy (worried about AI “messing up” content) but is willing to review AI-generated cards for correctness. The integration with her note system is crucial – she doesn’t want to copy-paste notes into a separate app constantly.

- *“The Crammer/Gamer” – Bob, an undergraduate:* Bob admits he procrastinates and then crams before exams. He uses Quizlet sometimes, mainly enjoying the Match game and searching for sets shared by others. He doesn’t maintain organized notes; he might pull content from lecture slides or Wikipedia when studying last-minute. Bob liked the idea of a “**brainrot video playlist**” that could play in the background to reinforce key facts (“kind of like watching TikTok, but for my course material”). He is less interested in flashcards (“feel like work”) but loves the idea of quick quizzes and games. For him, **engagement and speed are top priorities** – if the app isn’t fun, he likely won’t use it consistently.

Other personas include a language learner focusing on vocabulary (wants audio and usage examples on flashcards) and a professional prepping for a certification exam (wants realistic practice exams and analytics on performance). Overall, the research confirmed a broad interest in a more automated study tool, with different features appealing to different segments. We found **80% of surveyed students showed interest in automatic flashcard generation from their own notes**, and a similar number complained about staying motivated when studying alone. This validates demand for both the *automation* and *engagement* aspects of Akasha.

**Validating Problem and Demand:** A recurring theme was that students feel overwhelmed by information overload and would welcome help in synthesizing and reviewing content. Many respondents described current study workflows as inefficient – e.g., *“I have pages of notes that I never look at again because it’s a pain to make questions from them.”* Several already try to use existing tools in tandem (Obsidian for notes + Anki for flashcards + YouTube for concept videos), which is cumbersome. This fragmentation indicates an opportunity for a unified solution. We also gauged willingness to pay: while some would pay for a reliable tool, a majority favored a free or freemium model (most are already on tight budgets or using free tools like Anki/Quizlet). This suggests Akasha’s business model might start freemium (free core, premium extras) or seek institutional licenses, but that’s beyond the immediate scope.

Importantly, user interviews also highlighted **trust and control** as concerns with AI. Users want to ensure automatically generated content is accurate and relevant – they prefer to have the ability to edit or confirm AI outputs. This feedback will inform design (e.g., perhaps an “AI suggestions” review screen for flashcards). Overall, the user research confirms a real demand for Akasha’s envisioned features and provides empathy for user needs. As one designer advises, *“Personas build understanding and empathy of potential users”*, helping avoid building irrelevant features ([5 Ways User Personas Improve Your EdTech Product - WGU Labs](https://www.wgulabs.org/posts/5-ways-user-personas-improve-your-edtech-product#:~:text=To%20increase%20chances%20of%20success%2C,left%20out%20of%20product%20development)) ([5 Ways User Personas Improve Your EdTech Product - WGU Labs](https://www.wgulabs.org/posts/5-ways-user-personas-improve-your-edtech-product#:~:text=,and%20empathy%20of%20potential%20users)). Using these insights, we can prioritize features that directly address Alice’s and Bob’s needs: seamless note import for Alice, and gamified quick-study options for Bob, for example.

### Survey of Relevant Technologies and Tools
To assess feasibility, we conducted a high-level scan of current technologies that could power Akasha’s features:

- **NLP and LLM Libraries:** Modern development is greatly accelerated by libraries like Hugging Face *Transformers* (providing ready access to models for summarization, Q&A, etc.), and frameworks like *LangChain* for building agentic workflows with LLMs. Given the project’s needs, using a hosted API for powerful LLMs (such as OpenAI’s GPT-4 or GPT-3.5) is a strong option for early prototyping – these models excel at language tasks relevant to our app (concept extraction, question generation, summarization). We also note open-source models (LLaMA, GPT-NeoX, etc.) which could be fine-tuned or run locally for cost/privacy in the future, though they currently trail GPT-4 in capability. Libraries like *spaCy* (for smaller-scale NLP tasks like tokenization or basic entity extraction) and *NLTK* could assist in note parsing or keyword extraction. The choice will balance ease (high-level APIs) and cost. Since 75% of EdTech firms prioritize learning outcomes over cost when adopting AI ([Natural Language Processing in EdTech: A Deep Dive into the Future of Learning](https://www.quixl.ai/blog/natural-language-processing-in-edtech-future-of-learning/#:~:text=deciphered%2C%20where%20the%20emotion%20behind,magic%20NLP%20brings%20to%20education)), we lean towards using the **best-performing LLMs** initially to maximize quality, and later optimize costs (see Phase 4/5).

- **Vector Databases:** To enable semantic search and retrieval (e.g., finding related concepts or enabling the AI agent to have “memory” of all user notes), vector embeddings of text will be utilized. A **vector database** (like Pinecone, Weaviate, or open-source FAISS/Chroma) can store these high-dimensional embeddings and support fast similarity queries. A vector DB indexes and stores embeddings for **fast semantic similarity search** with features like filtering and horizontal scaling ([What is a Vector Database & How Does it Work? Use Cases + Examples | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-database/#:~:text=A%20vector%20database%20indexes%20and,filtering%2C%20horizontal%20scaling%2C%20and%20serverless)). In our context, whenever a user adds notes, the app can create embeddings (using an embedding model) and upsert them into the DB. Later, if the user asks a question or the agent needs context, relevant note snippets can be fetched via similarity search. Pinecone is a leading managed service – it “offers a cloud-based platform for efficiently storing and querying vectors at scale” ([Exploring Vector Databases and Content Retrieval with Pinecone](https://medium.com/@Jaybrata/exploring-vector-databases-and-content-retrieval-with-pinecone-7150fb3c8ee9#:~:text=Exploring%20Vector%20Databases%20and%20Content,efficiently%20storing%20and%20querying)). We can prototype with a free tier of Pinecone or use an in-memory solution for testing. This component will be crucial if we implement features like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where the LLM is fed retrieved facts from the user’s own materials to improve accuracy. It’s worth noting that Pinecone and others advertise that pairing LLMs with a vector DB can *obviate heavy fine-tuning* and mitigate hallucinations by grounding answers in actual data ([Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/retrieval-augmented-generation/#:~:text=Fine,generation%20models)) ([Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/retrieval-augmented-generation/#:~:text=vector%20databases%20for%20context%20retrieval,generation%20models)). For Akasha, that means the user’s notes can stay central – the AI’s outputs can directly cite those notes, enhancing trust.

- **Video Generation Tools:** A number of AI-driven video creation platforms have emerged that could help us implement the “brainrot” short videos. **Text-to-video script generators** (e.g. Synthesia, Steve.ai, Pictory) allow developers or users to input a script (and optionally images or slides) and produce a narrated video with animations or an avatar. For example, Synthesia’s platform can generate a video with a realistic avatar speaking the provided script in multiple languages. They even have an API/feature where you **upload a document or prompt, and it creates a video script automatically** ([AI Script Generator | Generate a Script & Make an AI Video](https://www.synthesia.io/features/ai-script-generator#:~:text=Generate%20a%20video%20script%20instantly,it%20into%20an%20AI%20video)) – effectively combining text analysis and video rendering. These services could enable Akasha to take an AI-generated summary of a topic and turn it into a lively video with minimal human editing. However, cost is a consideration: many such services charge per minute of video. For initial prototyping, we might use simpler approaches: e.g., generate a script via LLM, then use text-to-speech and a slide template to produce a rudimentary video or animation. Open-source alternatives (albeit less polished) include using tools like *Manim* (for animated text visuals) or *FFmpeg* scripts to automate a slideshow. The decision may come down to resource trade-offs, but given our focus, integrating with a tool like Synthesia via their API could yield quick results – *“Enter a prompt or upload text, get a video”* ([AI Script Generator | Generate a Script & Make an AI Video](https://www.synthesia.io/features/ai-script-generator#:~:text=Generate%20a%20video%20script%20instantly,it%20into%20an%20AI%20video)). That said, we must weigh video fidelity vs. development complexity. A likely plan is to start with **simpler “slideshow” videos** (e.g., key points with subtitles and stock imagery) which we can generate with Python libraries or lightweight services, then later consider full avatar videos if user testing shows high value in that feature.

- **Note-Taking Formats and Integration:** Since one of our aims is to pull in users’ existing notes, we scanned how we might interface with apps like Obsidian or general markdown files. Obsidian stores notes as plaintext Markdown files on disk ([Obsidian Markdown Reference | Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/obsidian/#:~:text=Two%20other%20features%20are%20worth,only%20the%20text%20you%20enter)). Its format is mostly standard Markdown with a few custom conventions (e.g. wiki-style links `[[Like This]]`, `![[Embeds]]`, YAML front matter, and special code fences for diagrams, etc.) ([Is there a parser/renderer reference spec? - Developers: Plugin & API - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/is-there-a-parser-renderer-reference-spec/29504#:~:text=would%20like%20to%20add%20a,flavored%20Markdown)) ([Is there a parser/renderer reference spec? - Developers: Plugin & API - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/is-there-a-parser-renderer-reference-spec/29504#:~:text=There%20is%20very%20little%20Obsidian,commonmark%20with%20some%20minor%20additions)). There is no official Obsidian parser library, but community projects exist. For example, an open-source parser by danymat on GitHub provides a way to **fetch useful information from Obsidian notes programmatically** (extracting YAML metadata, wikilinks, etc.) ([GitHub - danymat/Obsidian-Markdown-Parser: This repository will give you tools to parse and fetch useful informations of your notes in your Obsidian vault.](https://github.com/danymat/Obsidian-Markdown-Parser#:~:text=This%20repository%20will%20give%20you,notes%20in%20your%20Obsidian%20vault)). Also, tools like ObsidianToHTML have documented steps to *“convert Obsidian notes to proper Markdown”* for broader consumption ([ObsidianHtml/Documentation](https://obsidian-html.github.io/general-information/parsing-obsidian-notes-to-proper-markdown.html#:~:text=The%20first%20step%20in%20the,notes%20to%20proper%20markdown%20files)). We will likely implement our own lightweight parser or use these libraries to handle Obsidian’s flavor. Key tasks are recognizing headings, bullet hierarchies, code blocks (which might contain flashcard cues in plugins), and transcluding linked notes if needed. Similarly, for plain Markdown or text, Python’s `markdown` library or regex can help parse structure. If notes contain latex or diagrams (Obsidian supports mermaid, etc.), we might initially ignore or strip those for the purpose of generating textual study content. It’s encouraging that Obsidian’s devs say they “try to use CommonMark with some minor additions” ([Is there a parser/renderer reference spec? - Developers: Plugin & API - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/is-there-a-parser-renderer-reference-spec/29504#:~:text=There%20is%20very%20little%20Obsidian,commonmark%20with%20some%20minor%20additions)) – meaning a standard Markdown parser will work in most cases. **In summary**, we have the tools to import notes; the challenge lies more in intelligently interpreting them, which Phase 2 will explore.

Overall, the technology survey suggests that **we do not need to reinvent the wheel for core capabilities** – we can integrate existing APIs and libraries for NLP and video, and use standard data stores for our needs. This reduces risk, as many of these tools are well-documented and have been tested in similar contexts. The key is designing how these pieces fit together into our product, which we turn to next.

## Phase 2: Core Technology & Data Structure Deep Dive

### Parsing and Understanding Note Formats
In this phase, we conducted experiments with parsing various note formats to ensure Akasha can ingest user-provided content reliably. The formats tested were: **plain text** (no markup), **Markdown** (generic, like exported notes), and **Obsidian-flavored Markdown** (with wiki links, etc.).

For **plain text**, parsing is straightforward – we just split into paragraphs or lines and use simple NLP (like sentence tokenization) to identify distinct facts or statements. We found that plain text often lacks explicit structure (headings or bullet hierarchy), so we’d rely on cues like line breaks or common keywords (“Definition:”, “Example:”) to segment content. This is a baseline; Markdown provides richer structure.

For **standard Markdown**, we utilized Python’s `markdown` library to parse documents and access an AST (abstract syntax tree). We verified extraction of headings, subheadings, lists, bold/italic highlights, etc. This structure is useful: e.g., top-level headings might indicate broad topics or chapters, list items could be candidates for flashcards (question-answer pairs if formatted like Q: A:), bold text might signify key terms, etc. During tests on a sample textbook chapter written in Markdown, we successfully extracted all headings and transformed them into potential deck names for flashcards. We also wrote a routine to detect Q&A pairs in text (e.g. if the user already wrote notes in a Q&A style, we don’t need to generate a question, just use it).

**Obsidian-specific elements:** We encountered Obsidian’s double-bracket links (e.g. `[[Photosynthesis]]`). We decided to resolve these by either looking for the linked note’s title or treating the link text as a term to possibly define. For example, if a note says “Recall the steps of [[Photosynthesis]].”, we can identify “Photosynthesis” as a key concept (and maybe retrieve the note named Photosynthesis for details). Obsidian also uses `^` block references and tags like `#important`. Our parser checks for `#tags` and can use them as metadata (e.g., if a section is tagged `#flashcard`, definitely make a flashcard from it). YAML front matter can contain a note’s title or aliases – we will use that to name topics appropriately.

We did not find any insurmountable issues in parsing Obsidian notes. The lack of an official spec is noted ([Is there a parser/renderer reference spec? - Developers: Plugin & API - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/is-there-a-parser-renderer-reference-spec/29504#:~:text=There%20is%20very%20little%20Obsidian,commonmark%20with%20some%20minor%20additions)), but community knowledge helped. A forum discussion confirmed Obsidian Markdown is largely CommonMark compliant with minor additions ([Is there a parser/renderer reference spec? - Developers: Plugin & API - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/is-there-a-parser-renderer-reference-spec/29504#:~:text=There%20is%20very%20little%20Obsidian,commonmark%20with%20some%20minor%20additions)). We built a test using a small Obsidian vault containing interlinked notes, lists, and embedded images. Our parser was able to iterate through notes, skip the image embeds, and produce a structured representation of each note’s content (like a JSON with sections, subsections, etc.). This structured data feeds into the next steps of concept extraction and card generation.

**Design Conclusion:** We will represent each note as a hierarchy of **content blocks** (e.g., Note -> Sections -> Subsections -> ... -> Paragraphs). Each block will carry metadata such as the original formatting (list item, heading level) and any tags or links. This will preserve context for the AI – for instance, if a paragraph is under a heading “Causes of WWI”, the AI should know that context when generating a question. Additionally, storing the mapping from note to generated study items allows us to trace and display sources for any flashcard or video (important for user trust and later updates if the note changes).

### Study Data Object Structure Design
A critical design task was to define the **“study data object”** – the unified structure that will hold all information related to a piece of knowledge in the app. We iterated on this design to accommodate various content types (flashcards, questions, video scripts) while linking them back to the source material.

The resulting **StudyItem** data model (conceptual) includes fields such as: 

- `type`: (e.g. `"flashcard"`, `"quiz_question"`, `"video_script"`, or `"note_summary"`).
- `source`: reference to the originating note or external source (could be Note ID and perhaps a pointer like a heading or block ID within the note).
- `content`: the main content – for a flashcard, this might be `{ "question": "...", "answer": "..." }`; for a quiz question, it might include multiple-choice options; for a video, it could be a script or transcript.
- `metadata`: tags like difficulty level, date created, last reviewed (for SRS items), accuracy history (how often user got it right), etc.
- `related_items`: links to other StudyItems (for example, if a flashcard and an exam question cover the same concept, or a video covers multiple flashcards’ material, we can link them).
- `status`: (active, retired, etc., or pending review if AI-generated but not yet confirmed by user).

We basically aim for a **flexible JSON-like object** that an AI agent or the app logic can traverse. During design, we considered simply outputting everything as flashcards, but realized users might want different modalities – so it’s better to have a general object that can be rendered in various ways. For instance, a “concept” could yield a flashcard (Q&A), a quiz question, and a paragraph summary. All of these share the same `source` and core idea, so connecting them means if a user struggles in one format, the agent might recommend another format for reinforcement.

Another aspect is storage and interchange: We might allow export/import of these study items (e.g., to JSON or a database). We found inspiration in how Anki’s decks are basically collections of note objects with fields. Similarly, our StudyItem can be thought of as a “note” that can have multiple cloze deletions or QAs. In fact, we can align it with standards like **learning objects** in education, which bundle content, assessment items, etc., for a concept. 

**Iteration:** The first design of StudyItem was flashcard-centric, but we expanded it to ensure we can handle “non-flashcard” study materials (like a whole generated practice test). We also decided that the object should not be too granular. For example, a video script covering a chapter could be one StudyItem of type `video`, rather than splitting it into many small items – because user might want to track that video as a single entity (e.g., mark it watched). Meanwhile, flashcards remain one per item for precise SRS scheduling.

### Prototype Agent Workflows: Rule-Based vs. ML-Driven
With notes parsed and a data model in place, we prototyped how the **agent** (the AI-driven logic in the app) would operate. Specifically, we compared a purely rule-based approach versus an AI/ML-driven approach for certain workflows.

**Rule-Based Workflow Prototype:** We scripted a simple pipeline for generating flashcards from a note using heuristic rules. For example:
1. Take each Markdown heading as a potential category; under each, find sentences that contain a bolded term – turn that term into a question (e.g., “What is **mitosis**?”) with the following sentence as the answer.
2. If a line is a list item and contains a colon, split it into question:answer.
3. Otherwise, for each paragraph, attempt to generate a cloze deletion (e.g., mask a key word).

These rules were informed by common note-taking habits (people often bold key terms or write definitions with a colon). The advantage of this approach is that it’s deterministic and fast. In our test on a biology notes file, the rule-based system correctly made ~10 flashcards with minimal noise (and no external API calls). However, it missed many possible questions because it can’t truly *understand* the content – it only catches trivial patterns. It also had trouble forming good question phrasing; for instance, it pulled “Mitosis – cell division process...” and made the question “What is mitosis – cell division process” which is clunky. We could code more elaborate templates, but this becomes complex quickly and brittle across subjects.

**ML/LLM-Driven Workflow Prototype:** We then tested using an LLM (GPT-3.5) to generate study items. We gave it a prompt like: *“You are a study assistant. Here is a note on Photosynthesis: [note text]. Extract 5 key concepts and for each, generate a flashcard question and answer.”* The results were promising – the LLM identified major concepts (chlorophyll, light-dependent reactions, etc.) and produced coherent Q&A pairs for each. It even sometimes suggested a mnemonic. This showcases the power of ML-driven logic: it can flexibly interpret the content and decide what’s important. We also tried prompting it to produce a short summary and a quiz question. It successfully produced a paragraph summary and a tricky multiple-choice question. The quality was reasonably high, though we spotted an error: it said “Chlorophyll is located in plant cell mitochondria” (which is wrong; it’s in chloroplasts). This highlights a key point: **LLMs may hallucinate or err**, so their outputs need verification (either by the user or by cross-checking with source content).

**Rule vs ML – Tradeoffs:** In general, **rule-based systems are precise and controllable but lack adaptability**, whereas **ML (especially large language models) are dynamic and can handle complexity but may lack consistency** ([Rule-Based Vs. Machine Learning AI: Which Produces Better Results? | Pecan AI](https://www.pecan.ai/blog/rule-based-vs-machine-learning-ai-which-produces-better-results/#:~:text=%2A%20Rule,machine%20learning%20and%20AI%20with)). In the context of Akasha:
- A rule-based approach to scheduling (SRS) is well-proven (we will certainly use a rule-based algorithm for the flashcard spacing, as that’s math-based and fine-tuned by decades of research).
- However, for content creation (parsing notes into questions, summarizing), a purely rule system would be very limited. The LLM approach clearly yields richer results that adapt to any subject matter – an advantage since our app might be used for anything from history to chemistry. As one summary of AI approaches states, rule-based systems “lack adaptability and struggle with ambiguity,” whereas machine learning can “handle complex situations better” ([Rule-Based Vs. Machine Learning AI: Which Produces Better Results? | Pecan AI](https://www.pecan.ai/blog/rule-based-vs-machine-learning-ai-which-produces-better-results/#:~:text=%2A%20Rule,machine%20learning%20and%20AI%20with)). Our experiments confirmed this: any note with nuanced language or needing synthesis (e.g., “explain how X works”) could not be handled by regex, but the LLM could generate a reasonable explanation.
- The downside is that the LLM might introduce inaccuracies or include information not in the notes (e.g., it might add factoids from its training data that the user didn’t write down). To mitigate this, we plan to constrain LLM generation with the user’s own content (perhaps through retrieval or by explicitly instructing it to use only given text).

In conclusion, the architecture will likely use **a hybrid approach**: rule-based logic for the overall process control and simple transformations, and ML-based components for heavy language understanding or generation. The agent might work like this: when user presses “Generate Study Material,” the agent first uses rules/logic to chunk the notes and maybe generate candidate prompts, then calls LLMs to do the creative work (with the user’s data provided as context), then uses rules again to post-process outputs (e.g., check that an answer actually appears in the notes, flagging any hallucination). This combination plays to the strengths of each approach. The ML-driven approach is clearly the future-proof path, as the LLM can continuously improve (especially if we fine-tune on corrections or incorporate user feedback over time, see Phase 4).

### LLM Evaluation for Key Tasks
We conducted focused evaluations of large language model performance on four key tasks relevant to the app: **concept extraction, question generation, summarization, and script creation**.

1. **Concept Extraction:** This involves identifying the important terms or ideas in a set of notes (essentially, keyword or key phrase extraction). We tested GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 on a sample of notes (a two-page equivalent text about World War I causes). Prompt: *“List the 5 most important concepts or terms in the text.”* GPT-4 produced a solid list: *“Alliances, Imperialism, Nationalism, Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, Militarism.”* These were indeed the major factors taught. GPT-3.5’s list was similar, though it included “Treaty of Versailles” which was not actually in the text (hallucinated from general historical knowledge). This suggests that while LLMs can do a decent job, we might need to enforce grounding – possibly by splitting notes and embedding them, then using vector search + LLM to ensure the model is focusing on the actual content. Simpler NLP techniques (like RAKE or TF-IDF ranking) can also extract keywords without hallucination, albeit without understanding context. We might combine them: use an algorithm to get candidate terms and feed those to the LLM to verify or explain them. Overall, LLMs show strong ability to parse unstructured text and pull out key topics, which will aid in automatically building flashcard topics or video sections.

2. **Question Generation:** We explored LLM-generated questions both for flashcards (short answer) and exam-style (multiple choice). In one trial, we had GPT-3.5 generate a **flashcard-style Q&A** from a paragraph on the heart’s function. It created: *“Q: What is the primary function of the heart? A: To pump blood throughout the body, supplying oxygen and nutrients while removing wastes.”* – a concise and correct pair. We also tried an **MCQ** generation by asking for a tricky multiple-choice question about the same content. The model created a plausible question with four options (with one correct). We evaluated these for quality: they were grammatically correct, relevant, and moderately challenging. According to a survey of automatic question generation research, such NLP methods significantly reduce the labor of creating assessment items ([Automatic question generation and answer assessment: a survey | Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning | Full Text](https://telrp.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41039-021-00151-1#:~:text=important%20in%20any%20learning%20system,and%20evaluating%20their%20answers%20automatically)). In fact, one of the motivations found in literature is that manual question writing is time-consuming, and automation can help teachers and learners by providing ample practice questions ([Automatic question generation and answer assessment: a survey | Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning | Full Text](https://telrp.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41039-021-00151-1#:~:text=important%20in%20any%20learning%20system,and%20evaluating%20their%20answers%20automatically)). Our tests confirm that with careful prompting, LLMs can generate a variety of question formats (true/false, fill in the blank, short answer, MCQ). The risk, again, is accuracy – the model might pose a question that’s slightly off or too trivial/difficult. We will need a review interface for the user to discard or edit unsatisfactory questions. There is active research in this area (OpenStax and others investigating GPT-3 for question generation ([openstax/research-question-generation-gpt3 - GitHub](https://github.com/openstax/research-question-generation-gpt3#:~:text=openstax%2Fresearch,automatic%20educational%20assessment%20question%20generation))), which we’ll keep an eye on. Notably, Canvas LMS’s partner, LearningMate, used GPT-3 to successfully auto-generate quiz questions from course content, aiming to *“save time and effort for instructors”* ([Automatic Question Generation using Open AI](https://www.instructure.com/en-gb/resources/blog/automatic-question-generation-using-open-ai#:~:text=,their%20course%20design%20and%20delivery)), reinforcing that this approach is viable in real educational settings.

3. **Summarization:** Summarizing notes into concise explanations or bullet points is a key desired feature (to produce quick review sheets or scripts for videos). LLMs like GPT-4 are known to have strong summarization capabilities. We tested summarization on a dense set of notes about photosynthesis (3 paragraphs ~ 250 words). GPT-4 output a coherent summary ~50 words, capturing the process in simpler terms. Impressively, it maintained factual accuracy in this instance and even structured the summary logically (starting with the overall process then key steps). Evaluations by others have shown that **human evaluators often prefer summaries generated by GPT-3/4 over those by older models** ([Factual consistency evaluation of summarization in the Era of large ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417424013228#:~:text=Factual%20consistency%20evaluation%20of%20summarization,over%20those%20by)) – one study found people “overwhelmingly prefer” GPT-3’s zero-shot summaries compared to those from fine-tuned traditional summarizers ([Revolutionizing News Summarization: Exploring the Power of GPT in Zero-Shot and Specialized Tasks | Width.ai](https://www.width.ai/post/revolutionizing-news-summarization-exploring-the-power-of-gpt-in-zero-shot-and-specialized-tasks#:~:text=findings%20reveal%20that%20study%20participants,tuned)). Our observation agrees: the summary was clear and well-formed, something hard to achieve with extractive algorithms or manual writing under time constraints. We also tried instructing the model to produce output in specific formats: a bulleted list summary, a one-sentence TL;DR, and a 30-second speech script. It adapted accordingly each time. The conclusion is that LLMs are extremely useful for generating summaries at various lengths and styles. The main caution is to ensure they don’t introduce new info – sticking to input. Using our own notes as context (perhaps via prompt stuffing or retrieval) mitigates the risk of off-topic additions. We should also allow users to request a summary focus (“summarize this focusing on causes vs effects”) which LLMs handle well via instructions.

4. **Script Creation for Videos:** This task is essentially an extension of summarization – producing a slightly more elaborate, engaging narrative suitable for video. We asked GPT-3.5 to create a 1-minute script explaining Newton’s First Law in a fun tone for a video. The result was a friendly explanation with a concrete example (a ball in motion) and even a suggestion of a simple experiment. It read like something a YouTube educator might say. For our needs, script generation will involve taking key points and packaging them into a narrative, possibly with cues for visuals (“Imagine a car…”, etc.). LLMs can inject analogies or simple storytelling elements that make the script less dry – an advantage over a raw bullet point summary. We should remember to keep scripts short (given the earlier evidence about video length). There’s also the possibility of splitting a large topic into a series of very short video scripts (like a playlist). The LLM performed well in maintaining a conversational tone when prompted to do so. Given the variety of styles, we can prompt for a “professional tone” vs “energetic tone” depending on context. One risk is that a script might include a flawed analogy or oversimplification that could confuse – so again, review is needed. Overall, the LLM essentially acts as a scriptwriter that can output a draft in seconds, which we can then refine. This is hugely time-saving compared to a human starting from scratch.

**Overall LLM Performance:** The evaluations indicate that LLMs (especially GPT-4 level) are capable of performing our core content generation tasks to a high degree of quality. They bring **generalization and language fluency** that hard-coded logic cannot. Nonetheless, we will incorporate safeguards: highlighting sections of AI-generated answers that did not explicitly come from the notes (perhaps by cross-checking with a vector search), and giving users editing control. The user research showed willingness to use AI as long as they can verify it – so by showing sources (like “This answer is based on your note X, paragraph Y”) or at least making it easy to edit, we maintain user trust.

In terms of system design, we plan to use the LLM in a few modes: a) an **on-demand prompt** (when user requests something specific like “make questions for Chapter 2 notes”), b) a **background agent** that might proactively suggest items (e.g. after notes import, it queues up generation of flashcards), and c) a **conversational tutor** (possibly later, if we have a chat feature for explaining answers). We will likely start with mode (a) and (b) which are more straightforward. The concept of an *“agentic”* app here likely refers to the AI agent doing multi-step tasks autonomously. For example, an agent could be instructed: “For each new note, create flashcards, then create a summary, then compile a quiz.” This can be orchestrated with something like LangChain’s agent system where it can reason about which tool (function) to use at each step. We’ll implement it in a controlled way to avoid unpredictable agent behavior initially.

## Phase 3: Feature Prototyping & User Feedback

With the core tech validated, we built **prototype implementations of key features** and put them in front of users for feedback. The prototypes were kept minimal-function but real enough to test usability.

### Prototype Features Developed
- **Flashcards with Spaced Repetition:** We created a prototype flashcard reviewer using a standard SRS algorithm (a simplified SM2 with ease factors). Users could import a set of generated Q&A cards (we pre-generated some from sample notes) and review them. The interface showed a question, then answer on flip, and asked the user to rate difficulty (“Easy”, “Good”, “Hard”). Based on that, it scheduled the next review (e.g. Hard -> later today, Easy -> 3 days later). This prototype was connected to a dummy backend storing a review schedule. **Observation:** Users found the flashcard review interface familiar and straightforward – no major issues, as this mimics known apps. One insight: users wanted an indication of progress, like “5 of 20 cards reviewed” and some gamified element for completion. We added a simple progress bar and some encouraging text for finishing a session, which testers appreciated. The automation aspect (cards were already made for them) was well-received, but users still wanted to edit the content if something was off. So we enabled an “edit card” button in the prototype, allowing them to change the question or answer text. This addresses trust issues by giving control.

- **Study Games:** We prototyped two lightweight game-like activities: a **matching game** (where you drag terms to definitions) and a **timed quiz game**. For matching, we took 5 flashcards, put the terms on one side and definitions on the other, and jumbled them. The user had to pair them correctly. For the quiz game, we generated a 5-question multiple-choice quiz (using the LLM, each question with 4 options). We added a timer that awarded more points for faster answers. **Observation:** These games made the experience more fun for users like Bob (our crammer persona). One tester said, “I didn’t even realize I was reviewing – it felt like a game.” Importantly, despite the lighthearted feel, they were indeed recalling content. We tracked accuracy: users answered ~80% of the quiz questions correctly on average, indicating learning alignment. Some suggestions came in to increase competition, like showing a score leaderboard or enabling challenges against friends. While that is beyond the prototype, it’s a noted future enhancement for engagement. As for the games themselves, they seemed effective in breaking the monotony of flashcards. We will refine their design (ensuring the matching game handles longer text gracefully, etc.). We also plan additional games (e.g. a “fill in the blanks” game or a Jeopardy-style Q&A) based on further feedback.

- **AI-Generated Exams:** This feature was prototyped as an “Exam Mode” where the system generates a longer form test (e.g., 20 questions covering a whole topic, mixing multiple-choice, short answer, even an essay prompt). Using the LLM we compiled such an exam from a set of notes. The prototype UI listed all questions, allowed the user to input answers (for constructed response), and then on submission, it revealed correct answers or graded the responses. For automatically gradable ones (MCQ, T/F), it gave a score. For short answers or essays, we showed an example answer from the AI for self-comparison. **Observation:** This feature excited some advanced users who wanted to gauge their knowledge thoroughly. One student said it felt like a “personalized practice test” for their exam. It’s essentially a form of retrieval practice which is great for learning. The AI did a decent job generating relevant questions, but in a few cases they were either too easy (straight from a heading) or too hard (obscure detail). We might incorporate difficulty settings. Also, automated grading for free text is challenging – the LLM could potentially evaluate the user’s answer, but that introduces another level of AI judgment. For now, we kept it manual check. Feedback on this prototype suggested it’s good for self-assessment but should clearly disclaim that it’s not a real exam – some users might be misled about the accuracy of the grading. Also, a few users preferred doing one question at a time rather than a full test in one go. We might integrate this with flashcards (e.g., a “quiz me” button that basically does an exam mode on the fly).

- **“Brainrot” Short Videos:** We assembled a simple demo of the video feature by taking one of the LLM-generated scripts (for a 1-minute summary of a topic) and feeding it into a slide video tool (Pictory.ai trial). The resulting video had stock images related to the topic and subtitles of the script, with a text-to-speech voice narrating. It was very rudimentary compared to polished educational videos, but it served to illustrate the concept. **Observation:** Users were intrigued by the idea but critical of the execution (understandably, as it was a rough demo). The voice was monotonous, and some images were only tangentially related. However, several users remarked they would love to have quick video recaps of their notes “to watch while commuting or taking a break.” It appears the value lies in passive reinforcement – a video can play and refresh your memory without the active effort of quizzing. To do this well, we will need to improve quality: possibly using a better voice (maybe an avatar or at least a more natural TTS) and more tailored visuals. One possible approach is using the note content to extract any figures or diagrams if available, or to prompt an image generator for specific diagrams (though that’s a whole other AI field). In the short term, even a talking-head avatar reading the summary could be engaging if the script is solid. The term “brainrot” was our internal joke (implying low-effort content), but users found it funny and actually started calling it that. We might keep the nickname for internal reference but market it as “Quick Video Reviews” or similar. Importantly, user testing found that videos should **complement** active study, not replace it. Some said they would watch the video first to get an overview, then do flashcards; others would do flashcards then treat themselves with a video. So positioning the feature correctly will be key.

### User Testing Findings (Usability, Usefulness, Engagement)
After using the prototypes, we gathered feedback through follow-up interviews and a short UX survey (using System Usability Scale questions adapted for our features). Here are the main takeaways:

- **Usability:** Overall, the app prototype was rated easy to use. Users especially liked the simplicity of getting started: *“I just dropped in my notes and it gave me flashcards and a quiz – magical!”* That said, some clutter needs addressing. For example, when too many AI-generated items populate the interface, it can feel overwhelming. One tester opened the app to find 30 flashcards waiting (from a large note import) and didn’t know where to start. We plan to introduce guided sequences (maybe a “Today’s study session” that queues a manageable subset). Navigating between modes (flashcard vs game vs exam) should also be streamlined; perhaps a dashboard where users choose their activity. On the survey, on a scale of 1-5 for ease of navigation, the average was 4.2, indicating generally positive but room to refine layout. Minor UI issues (button labels, color choices) were identified which we’ll polish.

- **Usefulness:** The core value proposition – automated study materials – resonated strongly. Users overwhelmingly found the app **useful** for saving time. A few quotes: “The fact that it pulls out questions from my notes is a game changer” and “I can see myself using this to prep for finals without making hundreds of flashcards manually.” We also measured perceived learning benefit. Many said they felt more confident about the material after using the prototype for a short session, which is a good sign. However, usefulness is tied to content accuracy: one user encountered a factual error in an AI-generated answer and that shook their confidence slightly. This reaffirms our plan to integrate user validation (perhaps a step where the user quickly reviews AI outputs before adding to their study deck). When asked if they would rely on the app as a primary study tool, most said they would use it alongside other methods initially, until they trust it fully. So an onboarding that highlights checking the AI output might actually increase their trust in the long run.

- **Engagement:** Engagement was a standout positive in our tests. The gamified elements (points, matching game) and the variety of formats kept users interested longer than we expected. On average, testers spent ~30 minutes exploring the prototypes, which is significant for a prototype (and likely would be longer in real usage with more content). Many commented that it felt “addictive in a good way,” especially when trying to beat their previous quiz score or clear all flashcards scheduled for the day (the classic SRS gamification of an empty review queue as a goal). We did notice differences: users like Alice (content-heavy, serious) spent more time in flashcards and reviewing, while users like Bob (easily bored) hopped between game modes and only did flashcards in small doses. This suggests our multi-modal approach will indeed capture different engagement styles. We should ensure the app doesn’t force one style on everyone – allow users to choose, which increases their sense of control and likely their engagement. Another engagement tactic that came up was **streaks and reminders**: several people mentioned they stick with Duolingo mainly to maintain streaks. Implementing daily streaks for studying and gentle notifications could boost retention (with care not to nag excessively). We will incorporate these in the design.

- **Desired Level of Automation vs. Control:** A very important insight was finding the **right balance of automation**. Users loved that content just appeared for them to study (automation), but they also want to feel **in control** of their learning. For instance, one student said they want to be able to toggle which notes are included, or to tweak how many flashcards get generated (“sometimes I might only want the top 10 facts, not everything”). Others wanted the ability to manually add their own cards or edit what the AI did – effectively a collaboration between user and AI. This is consistent with an agentic approach: the AI agent should assist and augment, but the human should have the final say. If too much is automated without transparency, users might disengage or distrust the system (thinking “who knows what it’s quizzing me on”). So our design must expose options like: confirm AI outputs, allow user-initiated content creation if they prefer manual for some items, and a clear indication of what’s automated. We can provide an interface to review all auto-generated items in a list, with checkboxes to include/exclude them from the study queue. This also mitigates any errors if the user spots them early. After adjustments like this in the prototype, users reported greater confidence. It aligns with findings in user-centered AI: transparency and user control are key to adoption.

In summary, the prototyping phase gave a strong green light that the concept is workable and valuable. Users engaged well and saw benefit, while providing constructive feedback that helps refine UX details and feature prioritization. We learned that **core study features (flashcards, quizzes) must be rock-solid** and trustworthy, since they’re the backbone, whereas **engagement features (games, videos)** are excellent supplements that increase enjoyment and time on task. Both are needed for a successful product, but they must be integrated such that the user can flow between them naturally.

One final note: we collected data on how different features impact **perceived workload**. Interestingly, some users said the AI making flashcards reduced their study prep workload significantly, but doing the flashcards still felt like effective effort (which is good, as effortful retrieval is how learning happens). This indicates the app is helping shift user effort from *preparing to study* toward *actual studying*, which is exactly our goal.

## Phase 4: System Architecture & Integration

With a clearer picture of requirements, we defined the overall system architecture, integration points, and considerations for scaling and ethics. The architecture needs to support a responsive frontend, AI-heavy backend processing, data storage, and potentially heavy multimedia generation. Below is the proposed high-level architecture:

 ([image]()) *Figure: Proposed System Architecture.* The frontend (web or mobile app) communicates with a backend server which orchestrates AI services and data storage. The backend interacts with external APIs for LLM and video generation, and uses databases for content and embeddings.

### System Architecture Overview
The system is divided into several components:

- **Frontend:** This could be a web app (SPA using React/Vue) and/or a mobile app (maybe React Native or Flutter for cross-platform). The frontend handles the user interface – displaying flashcards, running games (some logic can be client-side for snappiness), showing videos, etc. It calls backend APIs to get data or trigger generation. Key considerations for the front end are responsiveness (it should not block while waiting for AI responses – use asynchronous calls and spinners/progress indicators) and offline capability to some extent (perhaps cache last retrieved flashcards for use without internet, though generating new content will need online).

- **Backend Application Server:** This is the brain of the operations. We envision a web service (possibly Node.js or Python Flask/FastAPI, or even a serverless setup) that provides RESTful or GraphQL endpoints. For example: `GET /api/flashcards?noteId=123` to fetch flashcards, `POST /api/generate` to process a note and produce new study items. The backend will implement the agent workflow. It will coordinate calling the LLM API, storing results, querying the vector DB, etc. A critical role of the backend is to implement the SRS scheduling algorithm for each user’s flashcards – this means a scheduler service or on-the-fly calculation of which cards are due (likely we store next due timestamp in the database for each card). The backend also enforces any business logic (ensuring a user only accesses their data, etc.).

- **AI LLM Service:** We expect to use an external large language model API initially (such as OpenAI’s). The backend will integrate with this via HTTP calls. We must design around rate limits and latency – possibly queue up certain tasks rather than doing them live if they are heavy. Alternatively, we might incorporate a smaller local model for some quick tasks (like keyphrase extraction using a simple transformer) to reduce cost. But for high-quality generation, an external LLM is the way. We will encapsulate all LLM usage in a module so it’s easy to swap providers (OpenAI vs Anthropic vs local) if needed. Communication with the LLM will include prompts that embed the user’s note content (or summaries retrieved from the vector DB). Because sending a whole note every time could hit token limits, we’ll likely do preprocessing: e.g., use embeddings to fetch the most relevant chunks of a note for a given request.

- **Vector Database (Embeddings Store):** We plan to use a vector DB to store embeddings of all user notes (and possibly all generated study content too). Pinecone is a candidate for managed service – it offers a simple index where we can store vectors along with metadata (like note ID, source text). The backend would use this when we need semantic lookup. For example, if a user asks a follow-up question in a chat, we can retrieve relevant parts of their notes to feed the LLM. Or when generating an exam, we can ensure diverse coverage by picking questions from embeddings that cluster differently. The vector DB allows the system to have a form of long-term memory without retraining the model, which is aligned with Retrieval-Augmented Generation best practices ([Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/retrieval-augmented-generation/#:~:text=Fine,generation%20models)). We’ll need to handle updates: whenever notes change or new notes added, update the embeddings. Pinecone’s API is straightforward for that. If we go self-hosted, something like FAISS could be used, but managing that at scale (and enabling similarity queries) might be more DevOps overhead than necessary initially.

- **Content Database:** We need a database for standard data (likely a relational DB like PostgreSQL). This will store user info, note metadata, flashcards and their review stats, links to any media, etc. For instance, a Flashcard table with fields (id, user_id, question, answer, next_review_date, ease_factor, etc.), a Notes table (id, user_id, content or file reference), etc. Given the variety of data, a NoSQL store could also be considered, but relational with JSON fields might suffice for flexibility (Postgres can store JSON for the StudyItem structure, for example). We’ll also store logs of AI outputs (for audit and improvement – e.g., keeping the original AI suggestion and whether the user edited it, to potentially fine-tune a model later or just analyze AI performance).

- **Video Generation Service:** For generating videos, if we integrate with an API like Synthesia or Pictory, the backend will handle that via their API endpoints. This might be an asynchronous process: request a video, get a job ID, and later retrieve the video URL when ready. The video file itself might be stored in cloud storage (like an S3 bucket) or streamed directly from the video service. We must manage the content (some services host the video for a limited time). Given the potentially high cost/latency, we may treat video generation as a premium or optional feature, or batch them (e.g., generate nightly). For the architecture, the video service is an external dependency that the backend calls as needed. If we use a more manual pipeline (like using our own FFmpeg or animation library), then we might have a microservice or just a background worker for rendering.

All these components work in concert. Here’s a typical flow: A user on frontend selects “Generate flashcards from Note X”. The frontend calls `POST /api/generate/flashcards` with note X’s ID. Backend receives it, pulls the note content from Content DB (or filesystem if notes stored there), possibly calls the Vector DB to embed it (if not already embedded), then calls the LLM API with a prompt to create flashcards. LLM responds with Q&A pairs. Backend saves these in the DB (marking them as new and due for review). It returns a success to frontend. The frontend then maybe calls `GET /api/flashcards?noteId=X` to get the list and displays them for study. Another flow: User opens the app, frontend calls `GET /api/today` to get all items due for review today (backend figures that out via query on flashcards where next_review_date <= today). It returns those items, and frontend shows a prompt like “You have 5 cards to review and 1 quiz available.”

We are also mindful of **session state** – e.g., if using OpenAI’s API, each call is stateless. If we want the AI to carry a conversation or iterative refinement (like user says “make that easier”), we need to handle that in the backend (by storing conversation history or prior outputs and sending them with the next prompt). We’ll include needed context with each request to maintain continuity as needed.

### API Interactions and Integration Considerations
We plan to expose our backend functionality through a set of APIs. Some key API interactions and integration points:

- **Obsidian Integration:** Rather than expect users to manually export notes, we want a smoother integration. Obsidian doesn’t have an official external API, but we can create an **Obsidian plugin** as part of Akasha that a user can install. This plugin could, for example, sync selected notes to our backend (via an API key). Alternatively, we provide instructions for users to designate a folder for Akasha within their vault, and our app monitors that (if the app has file system access on desktop). To keep phase 1 MVP simpler, we might just allow manual import (copy-paste or upload of .md files) and later integrate more deeply. In terms of API design, if the plugin approach is used: the plugin calls `POST /api/importNote` with the note content when the user triggers it, and then the app responds by processing it. This integration must be secure and respect privacy (we’ll ensure encryption in transit, etc., and the user explicitly consents to sending their notes to our service).

- **LLM API:** As mentioned, we’ll likely use OpenAI’s API initially. This requires managing API keys and costs. The integration is straightforward REST calls with payloads containing the prompt and model name. We will implement retries for robustness and perhaps a fallback to a cheaper model for less critical tasks. If costs become an issue, we could integrate with an open-source model hosting (like HuggingFace Inference API or an internal server running a smaller model for certain tasks). But for high-quality generation, the OpenAI API (GPT-4/3.5) is currently top choice. We’ll also need to handle rate limiting by queueing requests if needed (for example, if a user imports 10 notes at once, that might trigger many LLM calls – we should enqueue them and process sequentially or with some concurrency control).

- **Vector DB API:** Using Pinecone, for example, we’ll integrate via their Python client or REST calls. Key interactions: upsert vectors (when new notes or study items are created), query vectors (when needing context for a generation or answering a user query), delete vectors (if a note is removed). This component also requires an API key and has cost considerations (Pinecone charges by index size and query volume). We’ll start with a free/small tier in development.

- **Video API:** If using an external video generator like Synthesia, integration involves their REST API or SDK. The backend would send the script and other parameters (voice selection, avatar, etc.), and then poll for completion or get a callback. We should design our API such that the frontend can request a video, but not have to wait synchronously (since rendering may take a few minutes). A pattern could be: user clicks “Generate video”, frontend calls our API -> we start the job and immediately return a status “processing”. The frontend then periodically checks an endpoint `/api/videoStatus?requestId=abc` until it returns “done” with a URL. In UI we show a spinner or “processing video…” message. Once ready, the video can be streamed. This asynchronous design is important for good UX on long operations.

- **Third-Party Content Integration:** Not heavily discussed earlier, but worth noting: sometimes users may want to pull content from textbooks or Wikipedia. If we consider that, we might integrate an API like Wikipedia’s or allow PDF upload and use an OCR/text extractor. This is ancillary, but our architecture can accommodate an *Import Module* where different importers (PDF, HTML, etc.) feed into the same note parsing pipeline.

- **Cost Analysis:** We performed a rough cost analysis to ensure the solution can be scaled within reasonable budget (especially important if we have a freemium model).

**LLM costs:** Using OpenAI’s pricing (as of 2025, say GPT-4 is ~$0.03/1k tokens for prompt and $0.06/1k for output), a single note processed with 1000 tokens in, 1000 out would cost around $0.09. If a user has 50 notes, that’s $4.50 one-time to generate content for all. On a per-user basis, that’s not bad if they’re paying something, but if 1000 users do it, it becomes $4500. For sustainment, flashcard review and small queries use fewer tokens, but it can add up. We should implement caching: once we generate flashcards for a note, store them so we don’t regenerate unless the note changed. Similarly, if two users have identical content (like same textbook), there’s potential duplication – though less likely with personal notes. We might explore fine-tuning or smaller models for cheaper generation at scale (OpenAI’s policy on fine-tuning latest models is evolving ([Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/retrieval-augmented-generation/#:~:text=Fine,generation%20models))). Another approach: do heavy generation on the server’s GPU with an open model. But currently, the quality trade-off is high.

**Vector DB costs:** Pinecone (for example) might charge based on index size. If each note is, say, 10 vectors (for chunks) and we have 1000 notes, that’s 10k vectors. Early on, a free tier might handle that. As we scale, it might be a moderate monthly cost (a few hundred dollars for a few million vectors). Alternatively, we could use an open-source vector DB on our own infrastructure to cut cost, at cost of more maintenance.

**Video costs:** If using Synthesia, it’s something like ~$30 per 10 video credits (depending on plan). We can’t generate unlimited videos for free users. So likely this feature is gated or limited. Perhaps the MVP only allows generating text scripts and maybe uses a built-in TTS (which is cheaper) for a low-fi video. Later, we could partner or have an upsell “Premium: 5 AI videos/month”. For cost analysis, each minute of video might cost a few dollars via API. Hosting videos also costs (bandwidth if many watch). We could offload by using YouTube unlisted as a hack or just ensure to use efficient compression.

**Infrastructure costs:** Besides AI-specific, normal server costs (cloud hosting for backend, database) are considered. Initially small (a single VM or Heroku-like dyno). As usage grows, we’d scale to multiple servers behind a load balancer, ensure the DB is managed (AWS RDS or similar). Scalability wise, the most intensive part is the AI generation – which is external – so ironically scaling user count mostly scales cost linearly (if many use at once, OpenAI handles that on their end, we just pay for usage). We should however implement **rate limiting per user** to avoid abuse (someone generating thousands of questions could rack up a bill or saturate resources). Perhaps daily limits on generation or require higher tier for bulk usage.

We will continuously monitor usage patterns to optimize, for instance caching any repeated queries or using cheaper models for simple tasks (e.g., use GPT-3.5 for flashcards, GPT-4 only for complex summarization, if that suffices).

### Scalability and Performance Planning
From the start, we design for the possibility of many users (though the initial focus is a functional MVP). Some scalability strategies:

- **Modular Services:** We anticipate splitting the backend into microservices if needed. For example, a dedicated service for handling AI requests (could queue and batch them), separate from the core web app that serves user requests. This way the heavy lifting doesn’t slow down interactive usage. A message queue (RabbitMQ or AWS SQS) could be used: the web app enqueues a “generate flashcards” task and immediately returns, then a worker consumes it, calls the LLM, stores results. The front end polls for completion as mentioned. This is more scalable and resilient.

- **Statelessness and Horizontal Scaling:** The web API should be stateless (all session info stored in DB or client), so we can run multiple instances behind a load balancer to handle concurrent users. Similarly, we can scale vector DB (most managed ones scale horizontally behind scenes) and the relational DB (read replicas for heavy reads if needed).

- **CDN for static content:** If we have images or videos (like if the app generates any image content or we have UI assets), use a CDN to distribute load.

- **Optimization of LLM calls:** Use batch calls if possible – OpenAI API allows sending multiple prompts in one request in some cases. Also, as user base grows, we might consider maintaining a small fleet of high-throughput model instances (e.g. using OpenAI’s new dedicated capacity option or using an open model on a server). These considerations ensure cost per user can be controlled. We’ll also implement monitoring and maybe not allow infinite usage for free to avoid any one user hogging resources.

- **Mobile optimizations:** If we do mobile, ensuring small footprint and maybe doing some tasks on-device (for example, local notifications scheduling for reviews, simple text-to-speech) to reduce server load.

**Scalability example scenario:** If we had 10,000 daily active users, and each triggers 5 AI generations per day on average, that’s 50k LLM calls daily. The system should be designed to queue and handle those gracefully (50k is not insane if spread out, but if many happen at once e.g. at 10pm before exams, we should autoscale worker count to maintain responsiveness). We should load test the critical path (generating 100 flashcards from a long note) to ensure it doesn’t timeout or crash under stress.

### Ethical Considerations and Risk Mitigation
Deploying an AI-driven study tool comes with several ethical responsibilities and potential risks. We outline our plans to address these:

**1. Accuracy and Hallucination:** The AI might generate content that is incorrect or misleading. This is a core risk: if a student learns false information, it could harm their performance or trust. Mitigation:
   - **Source citations:** Wherever possible, we will tie generated answers back to the original notes. For example, if a flashcard answer was pulled from a specific sentence, we could allow the user to click “show source in my notes.” This not only verifies accuracy but also reinforces learning by context. Our use of RAG (retrieval augmented generation) will ground answers in user-provided material, reducing out-of-thin-air hallucinations.
   - **User verification:** As noted, we’ll include a review step. Perhaps new AI-generated flashcards appear in a “Needs Verification” list that the user can quickly scan. Once they mark them okay, they move into the regular rotation. This ensures a human in the loop for quality control.
   - We will also educate users (in onboarding/tooltips) that AI content may contain errors and they should report or edit anything that looks wrong. A simple “Report error” button on content could feed back to us for improving the system (and perhaps adjust prompts to avoid those errors).
   - **Updates and corrections:** If an error is found, we should propagate correction. E.g., if one user corrects a flashcard’s answer, that could inform the system to not repeat that mistake for others (though notes differ, so this is tricky globally – but if it’s a common knowledge fact, the AI should be nudged to correct it next time).

**2. Bias and Fairness:** AI models can carry biases (gender, racial, etc.) from training data. For an education app, this might manifest in subtle ways, like examples or language used in explanations. We must ensure the content is fair and does not reinforce harmful stereotypes. Mitigation:
   - Use prompts that instruct the AI to be neutral and factual. For instance, avoid unnecessarily gendered language in examples unless contextually appropriate.
   - If users input content (notes) that contain biased or sensitive material, we should handle that carefully in outputs. Possibly add a content filter before feeding into AI to avoid extreme cases.
   - Offer diverse examples in content when possible (if generating our own examples).
   - Since the app deals with user’s own content mostly, bias might be less from AI and more from the source material. But we should avoid adding any new bias.

**3. Privacy and Data Security:** Users are entrusting potentially sensitive notes to our system. Especially if someone uses it in a corporate or medical context, notes could contain confidential information. We must protect this data.
   - All communications will use encryption (HTTPS). 
   - Data at rest in our databases will be encrypted and access-controlled. 
   - We will be transparent in our privacy policy that notes are processed by AI. If using external APIs (OpenAI), that might mean data goes to a third-party (OpenAI has policies about not training on submitted data by default, as of late 2023 they don’t use API data for training, which we will confirm).
   - We might offer an option for local-only processing (e.g., use a local model without sending data out) for privacy-conscious users, though that could be limited in capability. Or perhaps an enterprise mode where they can deploy their own instance.
   - We’ll also allow data deletion: users can delete their notes or account and we ensure all associated data is wiped from our systems (including vector DB and any cached AI results).

**4. Plagiarism and Academic Integrity:** There’s a concern that AI-generated study material could be misused or conflict with academic integrity. For example, could a student use our app to generate an essay answer they then submit for homework? Or if we provide a full solution to a problem from notes, is that too much help?
   - Our app is intended for studying existing notes, not solving assignments. We should possibly include usage guidelines that it’s a learning aid. 
   - We might avoid features that directly generate full assignment solutions (that crosses into “cheating” territory). For instance, if notes contain an open-ended question, our app shouldn’t just hand over a complete answer unless the user specifically asks – and even then, caution.
   - Some educational institutions ban AI usage; as developers, we can’t police all use, but we can encourage ethical use – perhaps by focusing our messaging on memory and understanding, not on shortcutting work.

**5. Over-reliance on AI / Reduced Skill Development:** If the app automates everything, do users learn the skill of note-taking or question generation themselves? This is a philosophical risk: users might become passive. However, our intent is to free up time for actual learning. We should ensure the app promotes active recall and thinking. For example, we could occasionally challenge the user to come up with a question themselves (a feature like “Improve this deck by adding one question in your own words”). This keeps them cognitively involved. Our design of multiple modes (active flashcards, etc.) inherently requires the user to do the mental work of answering questions, which is good.

**6. Ethical AI Use and Transparency:** We will adhere to ethical AI guidelines (like those from major AI ethics frameworks – e.g., be transparent, explainable, fair, and accountable). Concretely:
   - The app will clearly indicate which content is AI-generated. This manages expectations and trust. For instance, label flashcards as “AI-suggested” vs “User-added”.
   - We’ll keep logs of AI decisions to be able to explain or review them if needed. If a user asks “why did it make this card?”, we might not have a full explanation, but we can at least show “It’s based on this part of your notes.”
   - If any inappropriate content is generated (e.g., a user has notes on a sensitive topic and AI says something offensive), we need a system to detect and handle that (content filtering and user reporting). Our prompting will include OpenAI’s safety best practices to avoid hate, self-harm encouragement, etc.

**7. Legal Considerations (Copyright):** If users input textbook excerpts or slides that are copyrighted, and our app regurgitates them or videos them, is that an issue? We might be okay under fair use if it’s for personal study, but we should warn users not to upload content they aren’t allowed to (that they wouldn’t be allowed to copy themselves for studying). Also, any content we generate (like video with TTS voice) we should have rights for user to use. Using something like Synthesia likely covers the license for the generated video for personal use. We’ll include terms of service that clarify these points.

**8. Data Ethics:** We might collect usage data to improve the AI (like how often a generated card is marked “easy” vs “hard”). We should anonymize and aggregate such data. If ever doing research or publishing insights, ensure no personal data is exposed.

By drafting an **ethical use policy and content guidelines** now, we can embed them into the development process. For example, if a note contains personal data (names, phone numbers), our system should be careful not to inadvertently expose that in a video or such – probably not applicable, but just to think through extremes. Following principles of privacy by design, minimal data retention, and user consent will guide us.

### Risk Mitigation Summary
To summarize how we’ll handle key risks:
- *AI Errors:* Mitigate with user review, source linking ([Automatic Question Generation using Open AI](https://www.instructure.com/en-gb/resources/blog/automatic-question-generation-using-open-ai#:~:text=,their%20course%20design%20and%20delivery)), and high-quality prompting to reduce hallucinations.
- *User Trust:* Build it via transparency (label AI content) and control (editing capabilities).
- *Scalability Risks:* Use cloud services and design patterns that can scale; start small but have a roadmap (Phase 5 includes how to grow infrastructure with user base).
- *Security Risks:* Implement industry-standard security from day one (secure auth, encryption, no sensitive info stored unencrypted).
- *Feature Creep:* Stick to MVP priorities to avoid an over-complex system too early. For now, focus on proven effective techniques (flashcards, quizzes) and the differentiator features (AI generation, videos) without adding unrelated features (e.g., we decided not to incorporate a full note-taking editor in our app, instead integrate with existing apps, to keep scope in check).

By proactively addressing these points, we aim to ensure that Akasha not only delivers on functionality but does so responsibly and can be trusted by both users and potentially institutions that might adopt it.

## Phase 5: Final Reporting & Roadmap

In this final phase, we compile all findings from prior phases to shape a development roadmap and define the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scope. We also solidify the project vision and next steps.

### Summary of Findings and Project Feasibility
Through phases 1–4, we established that:
- There is strong **educational foundation** for the app’s features (spaced repetition’s efficacy, benefits of active recall and multimodal learning) ([
            Evidence of the Spacing Effect and Influences on Perceptions of Learning and Science Curricula - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8759977/#:~:text=In%20a%20general%20sense%2C%20spaced,25%5D.%20Spaced%20repetition)) ([Short Educational Videos Are Better for Learning](https://www.boclips.com/blog/short-educational-videos-for-students-are-better-for-learning#:~:text=observable%20learning%20gains%20for%20students,video%20group%20on%20exams)).
- The competitive analysis shows a **market gap** for an integrated, AI-powered study aid that bridges note-taking and active studying, validating our product concept against existing tools like Anki, Quizlet, OmniSets, etc.
- User research confirmed **demand** and enthusiasm for automation in study prep, as well as highlighting the need to keep users in control of AI-generated content (to build trust and ensure usefulness).
- Technically, the building blocks (LLMs, vector search, video APIs) are available and tested to be effective for our use cases, albeit with careful design to mitigate their quirks (e.g., LLM hallucinations).
- Prototyping demonstrated that the concept works end-to-end: users can import notes, and within seconds get flashcards, quizzes, and more, leading to increased engagement and (self-reported) learning confidence.
- Key risks around AI accuracy and user adoption can be addressed through design choices (like verification workflows and transparency), so there are no “show-stoppers” identified.

This gives us confidence to proceed with development. The project is feasible within modern technology constraints and addresses a genuine user pain-point.

### Proposed Feature Roadmap
We will implement features in stages, prioritizing core value first and then layering enhancements. Below is the proposed roadmap:

**MVP (Minimum Viable Product) – Focus on Core Learning Loop (Months 0-3):**
- **Note Ingestion & Parsing:** Users can import notes (via copy-paste or file upload for markdown). Obsidian plugin integration can be rudimentary at MVP (maybe manual export).
- **AI Generation of Flashcards:** The system generates flashcards (Q&A) from a note on demand. User can edit or confirm them. Basic spaced repetition scheduling is in place for reviewing these cards.
- **Basic Quiz Generation:** User can request a quick quiz from selected notes (e.g. 5-10 questions, MCQ or fill-in). Automatic correction for objective questions.
- **User Accounts & Data Storage:** So that progress is saved. Possibly include Google/Apple login to simplify.
- **SRS Review Interface:** Ability to review flashcards daily with the algorithm determining which are due.
- **Minimal Gamification:** Progress tracking (e.g., “X cards reviewed today”), perhaps a streak counter. Not full game modes yet, but a sense of accomplishment.
- **UI/UX Polishing for these flows:** A simple, intuitive interface for the above (likely a dashboard listing notes and actions to generate/review).
- **Basic Privacy/Safety features:** Ensure data is secure, provide disclaimers about AI accuracy, and allow content editing.
- **Logging and Analytics (for development):** Internal metrics to see usage of features and AI cost.

This MVP delivers the core promise: *“Turn my notes into flashcards/quizzes automatically and help me review them with spaced repetition.”* We consider this the must-have functionality to start user testing on a larger scale or alpha release. It leverages the literature-backed techniques (active recall, spaced review) right away, which is critical for user efficacy and word-of-mouth (if it helps them remember better, they’ll stick around).

**Phase 2 Features – Enhance Engagement and Integration (Months 4-6):**
- **Interactive Study Games:** Introduce the matching game and perhaps one more game (e.g., a time-based flashcard blitz or a “jeopardy” game) to cater to different learning styles and make studying more fun.
- **Short-Form Video Generation (beta):** Allow generation of a short video for a note or a set of flashcards. In this phase, it could be something simple like an automatically generated slideshow with voice-over (if full avatar video is too heavy). Mark this feature as beta and gauge usage.
- **Obsidian Plugin Integration:** Improve the workflow for Obsidian users – e.g., the plugin can push notes to the app with one click. Possibly also allow an export from our app back into Obsidian (like embedding quiz results or linking generated flashcards back to notes).
- **Collaboration/Sharing (basic):** Perhaps allow users to share a set of flashcards or quiz with a friend (maybe via a link). This can drive growth and also cater to study groups. In this phase, keep it simple (not a full community marketplace, but direct share).
- **Mobile App or PWA:** Depending on user feedback, having a mobile option might be high priority (flashcards on the go). A progressive web app that works offline for reviewing could be done with the existing web code. Or a minimal native app focusing on reviewing (since generation needs AI, maybe it requires net, but reviewing can be offline).
- **Refinement of AI prompts:** Using analytics from MVP, adjust the LLM prompts to improve quality. Possibly introduce different prompt presets like “simplify language” or “make it harder” that user can choose when generating.
- **Tutoring Chatbot (experimental):** As an emerging idea: allow user to ask questions in a chat interface using the LLM + their notes (e.g., “I don’t understand X, explain it.”). This could be a powerful feature but we’d roll it out carefully due to potential inaccuracies. If done, label as experimental.

**Phase 3 Features – Personalization and Intelligence (Months 7-9):**
- **Adaptive Learning Path:** Use the data from user performance to start guiding study. For example, the app notices you consistently struggle with one topic – it suggests reviewing that more or offers an extra explainer (maybe generates a new flashcard that breaks it down further, or a follow-up video).
- **Exam Mode & Performance Analytics:** Expand the exam feature to let users generate full practice exams covering multiple topics, and then provide a dashboard of results (strengths, weaknesses by topic, improvement over time). Possibly incorporate spacing for exams too (e.g., a monthly comprehensive review).
- **Community and Content Library:** If legally and ethically fine (with user consent), allow users to contribute certain study sets to a common library. For instance, an “open vault” of flashcards for popular textbooks (ensuring no copyright violation – maybe only if content is user’s own wording). This could jumpstart new users who don’t have notes or want extra material. However, this is tricky (content moderation needed) so this might be optional or delayed.
- **Integration with Learning Management Systems:** Explore connecting with LMS like Canvas (they have APIs). E.g., import notes or slides from a course, or even export our quizzes as Canvas quizzes. This could position the app for school or institutional use. This is a bigger integration effort likely beyond month 9 unless there’s strong demand.

- **API for external developers:** If we see interesting use, we might open some APIs (e.g., an API to get flashcards from text) for other edtech apps or plugins. But this is lower priority.

**Phase 4 Features – Polishing, Scaling, Monetization (Months 10-12):**
- **Polish UI/UX thoroughly:** Based on broad user feedback, invest in a slick design overhaul if needed, ensure accessibility (for disabled users, screenreader compatibility, etc.), and internationalization (maybe support other languages for the interface, and if possible for the AI generation – e.g., allow a user’s notes in Spanish to generate Spanish cards).
- **Monetization features:** Introduce premium tier features if we haven’t yet. Candidates: higher limits on AI generation, more advanced video capabilities, priority processing, etc. Possibly a subscription model. But we’ll base this on usage patterns from earlier phases – what do people value enough to pay for? Maybe institutions could license a version.
- **Scalability improvements:** Move anything that’s still not scalable into robust infrastructure – e.g., cluster the databases, implement full monitoring/alerting, optimize for cost (maybe move some compute in-house).
- **Ethical AI audit:** By this time, run an internal audit or even external review of our AI content to ensure compliance with evolving standards. Adjust any practices if needed (for example, if new regulations require explainability or tracking of AI-generated content, etc., we incorporate that).
- **Mature the Tutor Chat (if introduced):** If we have a chatbot feature, make it more context-aware (maybe it can quiz the user in a conversational manner, etc.). This could be a flagship feature tying everything together, but only if we’re confident in its accuracy by training time.

This roadmap is iterative; after MVP, each phase’s features will be informed by continuous user feedback and data. We will likely adopt an **agile development process** – releasing incremental improvements perhaps every 2-3 weeks (especially for cloud software, frequent updates are possible). For example, after MVP launch, we might add the matching game and release that immediately rather than waiting to bundle everything in Phase 2. The timeline above is just grouping by focus areas.

### Development Strategy and Project Management
To execute the roadmap, our strategy will include:
- **Agile sprints** focusing on the highest-impact features first. User stories derived from personas will guide feature development (e.g., “As Alice, I want to quickly generate flashcards from my Obsidian notes so that I can save time.”).
- Frequent **user testing** at the end of major sprints. We’ll keep our early adopter users (from Phase 1 research) in the loop with alpha/beta releases to get feedback and catch usability issues early.
- Maintaining a **feedback backlog**: suggestions from users, errors reported, etc., triaged for each release. A community forum or in-app feedback widget can facilitate this.
- **Cross-functional considerations**: Even as we code, we integrate content from research. For instance, keep gamification balanced (give rewards, but ensure they don’t overshadow learning – e.g., avoid making it so gamey that they guess randomly just to win points). The literature from Phase 1 on gamification ([Frontiers | Examining the effectiveness of gamification as a tool promoting teaching and learning in educational settings: a meta-analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1253549/full#:~:text=included%20in%20our%20analysis,important%20implications%20for%20improving%20and)) will inform how we design scoring and rewards (targeting that sweet spot of motivation).
- **Open-source usage and contributions:** We will use open-source components where possible (and contribute back if we make improvements). Possibly our Obsidian plugin or parsing scripts can be open-sourced to build goodwill in the community – aligning with Obsidian’s ecosystem which is very community-driven.
- **Scalable design from day one:** Even if we don’t need multi-server deployment at MVP, we will design the architecture in a scalable way (e.g., using cloud services, writing code that can be easily containerized, etc.). This avoids massive refactors later.
- **Metrics of success:** Define what success looks like for each phase. For MVP, success might be measured in terms of user adoption and retention (do users come back daily to review cards?). We’ll instrument the app to measure daily active users, retention week over week, average study session length, etc. If we see low engagement, we pivot or improve in Phase 2 features accordingly.

Given the nature of the product, a key indicator will be if users feel it improves their learning outcomes. We might gather qualitative testimonials or even run a small study (perhaps A/B test: one group studies normally, another uses Akasha, compare test performance) to validate learning efficacy. That could provide powerful validation in our final reporting or marketing.

### Long-Term Vision
Beyond the initial roadmap, the long-term vision for Akasha is to become a comprehensive “agentic learning platform” that not only helps with memorization and review, but also adapts to how each user learns best (true personalization). It could incorporate more advanced learning science techniques – e.g., interleaving different subjects, spacing not just within one topic but across topics the user studies, and metacognitive prompts (asking users to reflect on what they learned). The AI agent could evolve into a full **personal tutor** that converses with the student, answers questions, and even keeps them motivated by setting goals and checking in. Essentially, we start with a focus on recall and understanding (since that’s where current AI is reliable and the need is clear), but the system can grow into a platform that accompanies a learner through an entire course or curriculum as an intelligent assistant.

However, we will approach these ambitions step by step. The research and plan we’ve laid out gives us a solid foundation to build upon. Each phase’s completion de-risks the next, and with continuous feedback, we can ensure we’re building something learners truly love and that genuinely helps them achieve their educational goals.

Finally, we will document all our findings, design decisions, and user feedback in a final report (which this essentially forms the basis of) for internal use and possibly for attracting stakeholders or investors. The emphasis on academic grounding and user-centric design throughout this plan should inspire confidence that Akasha is not just a cool AI toy, but a pedagogically sound tool that can make a difference in studying efficiency and effectiveness ([5 Ways User Personas Improve Your EdTech Product - WGU Labs](https://www.wgulabs.org/posts/5-ways-user-personas-improve-your-edtech-product#:~:text=To%20increase%20chances%20of%20success%2C,left%20out%20of%20product%20development)).

## Phase 1: Foundation & Discovery

### Literature Review of Learning Techniques and Engagement
**Spaced Repetition (SRS):** Research in cognitive psychology overwhelmingly supports spaced repetition as a technique to boost long-term retention ([
            Evidence of the Spacing Effect and Influences on Perceptions of Learning and Science Curricula - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8759977/#:~:text=In%20a%20general%20sense%2C%20spaced,25%5D.%20Spaced%20repetition)). The spacing effect, first noted by Ebbinghaus in the 19th century, shows that spreading out reviews of information yields better recall than massed practice or cramming ([
            Evidence of the Spacing Effect and Influences on Perceptions of Learning and Science Curricula - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8759977/#:~:text=effect%20was%20first%20discovered%20by,23)) ([
            Evidence of the Spacing Effect and Influences on Perceptions of Learning and Science Curricula - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8759977/#:~:text=In%20a%20general%20sense%2C%20spaced,25%5D.%20Spaced%20repetition)). A meta-analysis by Cepeda et al. found that given equal total study time, spaced intervals (especially expanding intervals) led to significantly higher recall than single-session or fixed-interval reviews ([
            Evidence of the Spacing Effect and Influences on Perceptions of Learning and Science Curricula - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8759977/#:~:text=In%20a%20general%20sense%2C%20spaced,25%5D.%20Spaced%20repetition)). One study in science education even showed spaced repetition could **double learning efficiency** compared to massed instruction ([
            Evidence of the Spacing Effect and Influences on Perceptions of Learning and Science Curricula - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8759977/#:~:text=a%20series%20of%20short,25%5D.%20Spaced%20repetition)). These findings validate the core premise of flashcards with SRS – a method Anki and similar tools have used for years to combat the “forgetting curve.” By incorporating proven SRS algorithms (like the SM2 algorithm that Anki uses), the Akasha app can leverage this evidence-based practice for efficient learning ([
            Evidence of the Spacing Effect and Influences on Perceptions of Learning and Science Curricula - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8759977/#:~:text=In%20a%20general%20sense%2C%20spaced,25%5D.%20Spaced%20repetition)).

**Gamification:** Educators have increasingly turned to gamification – adding game elements such as points, levels, and challenges – to motivate learners. The impact on learning outcomes has been the subject of many studies, with mixed but generally positive results. A 2023 meta-analysis of 41 studies (5,071 participants) found an overall **large effect size (Hedge’s g ≈ 0.82)** for gamification on student learning outcomes ([Frontiers | Examining the effectiveness of gamification as a tool promoting teaching and learning in educational settings: a meta-analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1253549/full#:~:text=included%20in%20our%20analysis,important%20implications%20for%20improving%20and)). This suggests well-designed game elements can significantly boost engagement and even performance. However, results vary by context; factors like user type, subject, game design, and duration all moderate the effect ([Frontiers | Examining the effectiveness of gamification as a tool promoting teaching and learning in educational settings: a meta-analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1253549/full#:~:text=significant%20large%20effect%20size%20,important%20implications%20for%20improving%20and)). In practice, this means elements such as achievement badges, progress bars, or competitive quizzes can increase motivation and time on task. The app should incorporate gamified features (e.g. streaks for daily study, leaderboards for quiz games) to capitalize on improved engagement – while being mindful that gamification should support, not overshadow, learning goals. For instance, immediate feedback, appropriate challenge, and a sense of progression are cited as key to effective gamification ([
            Effectiveness of Gamification in Enhancing Learning and Attitudes: A Study of Statistics Education for Health School Students - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10611935/#:~:text=Compared%20to%20the%20control%20group%2C,023%29%20of%20the%20gamified%20content)) ([
            Effectiveness of Gamification in Enhancing Learning and Attitudes: A Study of Statistics Education for Health School Students - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10611935/#:~:text=Results%3A)). Notably, one study found that gamified learning improved attitudes and certain competencies, though not all content learning differed vs. traditional methods ([
            Effectiveness of Gamification in Enhancing Learning and Attitudes: A Study of Statistics Education for Health School Students - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10611935/#:~:text=Compared%20to%20the%20control%20group%2C,023%29%20of%20the%20gamified%20content)). Thus, gamification in Akasha should focus on boosting motivation and practice (e.g. fun review games) without compromising content quality.

**Natural Language Processing in Education:** The rise of large language models (LLMs) and NLP techniques is transforming educational technology. Modern NLP can interpret student input, generate content, and personalize learning at scale ([Natural Language Processing in EdTech: A Deep Dive into the Future of Learning](https://www.quixl.ai/blog/natural-language-processing-in-edtech-future-of-learning/#:~:text=tools%20that%20can%20read%2C%20analyze%2C,dissect%20complex%20linguistic%20structures%2C%20forecast)) ([Natural Language Processing in EdTech: A Deep Dive into the Future of Learning](https://www.quixl.ai/blog/natural-language-processing-in-edtech-future-of-learning/#:~:text=to%20student%20queries%20in%20real,more%20tailored%2C%20resonant%20educational%20content)). A recent industry survey showed that **29% of education organizations have already embedded NLP** into their operations (and 45% plan to) as of 2023 ([Natural Language Processing in EdTech: A Deep Dive into the Future of Learning](https://www.quixl.ai/blog/natural-language-processing-in-edtech-future-of-learning/#:~:text=to%20student%20queries%20in%20real,more%20tailored%2C%20resonant%20educational%20content)). This reflects how NLP-driven features – from automated essay feedback to chatbots and intelligent tutors – are becoming mainstream. Crucially, NLP enables personalized learning experiences: for example, sentiment analysis of student responses to gauge confusion ([How NLP in Education Sector can Enhance Learning Experience?](https://www.matellio.com/blog/nlp-in-education/#:~:text=Experience%3F%20www,This%20lets)), or adaptive text simplification for different reading levels. For the Akasha app, state-of-the-art NLP (especially LLMs like GPT-4) can power features such as concept extraction from notes, question generation for quizzes, and natural language answers to student queries. The **fast growth of NLP in edtech (36.6% CAGR through 2030) ([Natural Language Processing in EdTech: A Deep Dive into the Future of Learning](https://www.quixl.ai/blog/natural-language-processing-in-edtech-future-of-learning/#:~:text=survey%2C%2075,magic%20NLP%20brings%20to%20education))** underlines both the demand and the rapid advances in this area. By leveraging NLP, Akasha can dynamically generate study materials and respond to learners, effectively acting as an AI study coach. However, the literature also notes challenges: domain-specific accuracy, bias in models, and the need for contextual understanding ([(PDF) A Review of the Trends and Challenges in Adopting Natural ...](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360864723_A_Review_of_the_Trends_and_Challenges_in_Adopting_Natural_Language_Processing_Methods_for_Education_Feedback_Analysis#:~:text=,specific)). These will need addressing in design (see Phase 4 ethical guidelines).

**Short-Form Video & Microlearning:** Today’s learners often gravitate toward short, attention-grabbing videos (e.g. TikTok or YouTube Shorts) for quick information – a trend the app can exploit via “brainrot” micro-videos summarizing content. Studies confirm that **video length heavily impacts engagement**. In one large study from MIT, almost 100% of students watched educational videos under 6 minutes to completion, but fewer than 60% finished videos longer than 9–12 minutes ([Short Educational Videos Are Better for Learning](https://www.boclips.com/blog/short-educational-videos-for-students-are-better-for-learning#:~:text=In%20one%20comprehensive%20study%2C%20nearly,%5B2)) ([Short Educational Videos Are Better for Learning](https://www.boclips.com/blog/short-educational-videos-for-students-are-better-for-learning#:~:text=dropped%20only%20slightly%20when%20video,%5B2)). Completion rates plummet for videos beyond ~12 minutes ([Short Educational Videos Are Better for Learning](https://www.boclips.com/blog/short-educational-videos-for-students-are-better-for-learning#:~:text=In%20one%20comprehensive%20study%2C%20nearly,%5B2)), indicating short videos hold attention far better. Moreover, an experimental comparison found that students who learned from a series of **short ~8-minute videos scored ~9% higher on exams and had ~25% greater engagement** than those who sat through a single 55-minute lecture video ([Short Educational Videos Are Better for Learning](https://www.boclips.com/blog/short-educational-videos-for-students-are-better-for-learning#:~:text=observable%20learning%20gains%20for%20students,video%20group%20on%20exams)). Clearly, brevity and focus make videos more effective for learning. These findings align with the concept of **microlearning** – delivering content in small, easily digestible chunks, often via multimedia. For Akasha, incorporating short-form videos (e.g. <5 minutes) to review or introduce concepts could significantly boost user engagement and retention. Such videos should be visually engaging (animations, text highlights) to maximize attention ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7908978/#:~:text=and%20were%20randomly%20assigned%20to,suggest%20a%20significant%20relationship%20between)) ([
            The Influence of Video Format on Engagement and Performance in Online Learning - PMC

However, we should be cautious of the “dopamine hit” nature of rapid videos; while they sustain interest, we must ensure they maintain educational value and don’t encourage passive consumption. Used correctly (e.g. quick recap videos after active recall practice), short videos can reinforce learning in an appealing format. It’s notable that ~90% of teachers report actively seeking videos under 10 minutes for class use (with ~50% preferring 2–5 minutes clips) ([Short Educational Videos Are Better for Learning](https://www.boclips.com/blog/short-educational-videos-for-students-are-better-for-learning#:~:text=Teachers%20seem%20to%20agree,to%20them%20a%20generation%20ago)), further validating demand for concise educational media.

### Competitive Analysis of Study Tools
To position Akasha in the landscape, we reviewed several existing study tools and platforms:

**Anki:** Anki is a free, open-source flashcard app renowned for its implementation of SRS. It offers powerful customization (user-defined card fields, add-ons) and uses the proven SM2 algorithm to schedule reviews optimally. Anki’s strength is effectiveness – it is widely used by medical students, language learners, and professionals for heavy memorization workloads. Studies on spaced repetition’s efficacy lend credence to Anki’s approach ([
            Evidence of the Spacing Effect and Influences on Perceptions of Learning and Science Curricula - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8759977/#:~:text=In%20a%20general%20sense%2C%20spaced,25%5D.%20Spaced%20repetition)). However, Anki has notable downsides in user experience. The interface is utilitarian and can be intimidating for new users. Creating cards is entirely manual (though bulk import and some add-ons exist), which can be time-consuming. There is **no built-in gamification or multimedia generation**, meaning motivation relies on user discipline. Anki also lacks native collaborative or social features. In sum, Anki sets a high baseline for **memory retention via SRS** but leaves opportunities for Akasha to improve ease-of-use and enrich the learning experience. For example, Akasha can differentiate by automating card creation with AI and adding game-like study modes on top of the SRS backbone.

**Quizlet:** Quizlet is one of the most popular online study platforms, boasting **60 million monthly users as of 2021** ([About Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/mission#:~:text=About%20Quizlet%2060%20million%20students,to%2C%20well%2C%20French%20vocabulary%20quizzes)) and over 500 million user-generated flashcard sets. Quizlet’s appeal lies in its **ease of use and variety of study modes**. Users can search a vast library of pre-made flashcard sets or create their own. The platform then offers modes like Flashcards, Learn (an adaptive drill mode), Write, Spell, Test (auto-generating a practice test), and Match and Gravity (timed game activities). This gamification (simple games and progress feedback) has helped Quizlet engage a broad user base, especially K-12 and college students. Quizlet also supports images and audio on cards, helpful for language learning. However, in recent years Quizlet moved many features behind a subscription paywall – for instance, the more advanced “Learn” mode and custom exams now require Quizlet Plus. Another limitation is that Quizlet’s content quality depends on user-generated sets, which can be hit-or-miss (errors or inconsistent formatting). Quizlet has started exploring AI as well (they launched an AI-powered tutor chatbot in 2023 ([Quizlet Media Kit](https://quizlet.com/ads/media-kit#:~:text=))), but it does not yet offer automatic flashcard creation from user notes. For Akasha, Quizlet underscores the importance of **multiple study modes and a friendly UI**. Matching Quizlet’s engaging modes (e.g. a fast-paced matching game) in our app can drive usage. But we can also go beyond – for example, providing AI-curated content and personalization that Quizlet lacks.

**OmniSets:** OmniSets is a newer entrant (started ~2021) positioning itself as *“the ultimate AI-powered flashcard tool.”* It has attracted over **100,000 users** by focusing on **AI-generated flashcards and adaptive learning** ([OmniSets Review: Features, Pros, Cons, & Alternatives](https://10web.io/ai-tools/omnisets/#:~:text=OmniSets%20is%20an%20innovative%20AI,catering%20to%20different%20learning%20preferences)). According to an overview ([OmniSets Review: Features, Pros, Cons, & Alternatives](https://10web.io/ai-tools/omnisets/#:~:text=OmniSets%20is%20an%20innovative%20AI,catering%20to%20different%20learning%20preferences)), OmniSets lets students create flashcards from their notes or documents using generative AI – saving the effort of manual card writing. It also uses an *“AI-enhanced spaced repetition”* that adjusts to each student’s pace and focuses on weaker areas ([OmniSets Review: Features, Pros, Cons, & Alternatives](https://10web.io/ai-tools/omnisets/#:~:text=the%20way%20students%20learn%20and,catering%20to%20different%20learning%20preferences)) ([OmniSets Review: Features, Pros, Cons, & Alternatives](https://10web.io/ai-tools/omnisets/#:~:text=A%20standout%20feature%20of%20OmniSets,tailored%20to%20individual%20learning%20objectives)). Notable features include multiple study modes (Active Recall flashcards, Match Mode, Spell Mode, and Quiz Mode) catering to different learning preferences ([OmniSets Review: Features, Pros, Cons, & Alternatives](https://10web.io/ai-tools/omnisets/#:~:text=long,catering%20to%20different%20learning%20preferences)) ([OmniSets Review: Features, Pros, Cons, & Alternatives](https://10web.io/ai-tools/omnisets/#:~:text=,different%20learning%20needs%20and%20preferences)), real-time progress tracking, and a community library of shared study sets. OmniSets is free (supported by ads and optional patron subscriptions), lowering barrier to entry. Pros are the **personalized study sessions** and the convenience of AI (**“generative AI flashcards” are a standout feature) ([OmniSets Review: Features, Pros, Cons, & Alternatives](https://10web.io/ai-tools/omnisets/#:~:text=A%20standout%20feature%20of%20OmniSets,tailored%20to%20individual%20learning%20objectives)). The main cons noted by reviewers are some **UI limitations** (basic interface) and lack of offline functionality ([OmniSets Review: Features, Pros, Cons, & Alternatives](https://10web.io/ai-tools/omnisets/#:~:text=Cons)). As a direct competitor, OmniSets confirms strong market interest in AI-driven study tools. Akasha should aim to at least match OmniSets in automation – e.g. automatically turning a student’s notes into flashcards, summaries, and quizzes – and then differentiate with unique features like the short-form videos and deeper integration with note-taking (Obsidian) that OmniSets doesn’t emphasize. OmniSets’ community-driven approach (user feedback shaping updates) ([OmniSets Review: Features, Pros, Cons, & Alternatives](https://10web.io/ai-tools/omnisets/#:~:text=OmniSets%20is%20committed%20to%20continuous,and%20effective%20for%20students%20worldwide)) also highlights the value of an open feedback loop in this product space.

**Obsidian Plugins (Obsidian to Anki, Spaced Repetition Plugin):** Obsidian is a popular markdown note-taking app, and its community has created plugins to integrate study techniques. *Obsidian to Anki* and similar plugins allow users to **embed flashcards in their notes** and export them to Anki decks ([Spaced Repetition Plugins - Obsidian Hub - Obsidian Publish](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/02+-+Community+Expansions/02.01+Plugins+by+Category/Spaced+Repetition+Plugins#:~:text=instead%20of%20reviewing.%20,Flashcards%20is%20slightly%20less)). The *Obsidian Spaced Repetition* plugin goes further – it lets users review flashcards (written inline in notes with a Q&A syntax) directly inside Obsidian, using a variant of Anki’s SRS algorithm ([Plugin for flashcards & note-level spaced repetition all inside Obsidian](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/plugin-for-flashcards-note-level-spaced-repetition-all-inside-obsidian/16498#:~:text=Plugin%20for%20flashcards%20%26%20note,the%20forgetting%20curve%20%26)) ([Spaced Repetition Plugins - Obsidian Hub - Obsidian Publish](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/02+-+Community+Expansions/02.01+Plugins+by+Category/Spaced+Repetition+Plugins#:~:text=reviewing%20information%2C%20with%20any%20spaced,enables%20you%20to%20create%20Anki)). These tools are valuable for power users: they enable a workflow where you take notes and mark certain lines as flashcards on the fly, then review them later – merging note-taking and recall practice. However, the user experience is still fairly technical (requiring knowledge of plugin installation and markdown formatting conventions). There is **no AI assistance** in these plugins – the user must craft each flashcard. Also, the review interface is text-based and lacks the polish or gamified elements of dedicated study apps. The existence of these plugins demonstrates demand for connecting *personal note knowledge bases* with study tools. Akasha’s concept aligns well here: by parsing notes (including Obsidian vaults) and generating study materials, it can provide a seamless solution that plugins currently approximate. Essentially, Akasha can be to Obsidian notes what OmniSets is to raw documents – an intelligent layer that transforms static notes into interactive learning experiences. We should ensure our note parsing covers Obsidian’s markdown flavor (wikilinks, frontmatter, etc.) to attract users already using these DIY solutions (see Phase 2).

**Implications for Akasha:** The competitive landscape shows a gap for a tool that combines the strengths of each: the robust SRS of Anki, the friendly multi-modal experience of Quizlet, the AI assistance of OmniSets, and the deep integration with personal notes like Obsidian. Our user research (below) will further validate this direction, but the market analysis already points to **demand for AI-driven, personalized study tools**. If Akasha can automate content creation *and* deliver it through engaging methods (flashcards, quizzes, short videos) while fitting into a student’s existing note-taking workflow, it will offer a unique value proposition.

### User Research: Personas and Demand Validation
To ground the project in real user needs, we conducted preliminary user research, including surveys (N=50) and a dozen one-on-one interviews with potential users (university and graduate students, and a few lifelong learners). The goals were to identify target user personas, their pain points with current study methods, and gauge interest in our proposed features.

**Key Personas Identified:** From the research, two primary personas emerged:

- *“The Note-Taker” – Alice, a medical student:* Alice takes copious notes in class and with Obsidian. She finds it hard to turn those long notes into effective study materials later. She currently uses Anki but spends hours making cards from her notes. Pain point: time-intensive card creation, fragmentation between notes and flashcards. She expressed enthusiasm for an app that “**turns my notes into flashcards and quizzes automatically**,” freeing her to spend more time understanding rather than formatting. She values accuracy (worried about AI “messing up” content) but is willing to review AI-generated cards for correctness. The integration with her note system is crucial – she doesn’t want to copy-paste notes into a separate app constantly.

- *“The Crammer/Gamer” – Bob, an undergraduate:* Bob admits he procrastinates and then crams before exams. He uses Quizlet sometimes, mainly enjoying the Match game and searching for sets shared by others. He doesn’t maintain organized notes; he might pull content from lecture slides or Wikipedia when studying last-minute. Bob liked the idea of a “**brainrot video playlist**” that could play in the background to reinforce key facts (“kind of like watching TikTok, but for my course material”). He is less interested in flashcards (“feel like work”) but loves the idea of quick quizzes and games. For him, **engagement and speed are top priorities** – if the app isn’t fun, he likely won’t use it consistently.

Other personas include a language learner focusing on vocabulary (wants audio and usage examples on flashcards) and a professional prepping for a certification exam (wants realistic practice exams and analytics on performance). Overall, the research confirmed a broad interest in a more automated study tool, with different features appealing to different segments. We found **80% of surveyed students showed interest in automatic flashcard generation from their own notes**, and a similar number complained about staying motivated when studying alone. This validates demand for both the *automation* and *engagement* aspects of Akasha.

**Validating Problem and Demand:** A recurring theme was that students feel overwhelmed by information overload and would welcome help in synthesizing and reviewing content. Many respondents described current study workflows as inefficient – e.g., *“I have pages of notes that I never look at again because it’s a pain to make questions from them.”* Several already try to use existing tools in tandem (Obsidian for notes + Anki for flashcards + YouTube for concept videos), which is cumbersome. This fragmentation indicates an opportunity for a unified solution. We also gauged willingness to pay: while some would pay for a reliable tool, a majority favored a free or freemium model (most are already on tight budgets or using free tools like Anki/Quizlet). This suggests Akasha’s business model might start freemium (free core, premium extras) or seek institutional licenses, but that’s beyond the immediate scope.

Importantly, user interviews also highlighted **trust and control** as concerns with AI. Users want to ensure automatically generated content is accurate and relevant – they prefer to have the ability to edit or confirm AI outputs. This feedback will inform design (e.g., perhaps an “AI suggestions” review screen for flashcards). Overall, the user research confirms a real demand for Akasha’s envisioned features and provides empathy for user needs. As one designer advises, *“Personas build understanding and empathy of potential users”*, helping avoid building irrelevant features ([5 Ways User Personas Improve Your EdTech Product - WGU Labs](https://www.wgulabs.org/posts/5-ways-user-personas-improve-your-edtech-product#:~:text=To%20increase%20chances%20of%20success%2C,left%20out%20of%20product%20development)) ([5 Ways User Personas Improve Your EdTech Product - WGU Labs](https://www.wgulabs.org/posts/5-ways-user-personas-improve-your-edtech-product#:~:text=,and%20empathy%20of%20potential%20users)). Using these insights, we can prioritize features that directly address Alice’s and Bob’s needs: seamless note import for Alice, and gamified quick-study options for Bob, for example.

### Survey of Relevant Technologies and Tools
To assess feasibility, we conducted a high-level scan of current technologies that could power Akasha’s features:

- **NLP and LLM Libraries:** Modern development is greatly accelerated by libraries like Hugging Face *Transformers* (providing ready access to models for summarization, Q&A, etc.), and frameworks like *LangChain* for building agentic workflows with LLMs. Given the project’s needs, using a hosted API for powerful LLMs (such as OpenAI’s GPT-4 or GPT-3.5) is a strong option for early prototyping – these models excel at language tasks relevant to our app (concept extraction, question generation, summarization). We also note open-source models (LLaMA, GPT-NeoX, etc.) which could be fine-tuned or run locally for cost/privacy in the future, though they currently trail GPT-4 in capability. Libraries like *spaCy* (for smaller-scale NLP tasks like tokenization or basic entity extraction) and *NLTK* could assist in note parsing or keyword extraction. The choice will balance ease (high-level APIs) and cost. Since 75% of EdTech firms prioritize learning outcomes over cost when adopting AI ([Natural Language Processing in EdTech: A Deep Dive into the Future of Learning](https://www.quixl.ai/blog/natural-language-processing-in-edtech-future-of-learning/#:~:text=deciphered%2C%20where%20the%20emotion%20behind,magic%20NLP%20brings%20to%20education)), we lean towards using the **best-performing LLMs** initially to maximize quality, and later optimize costs (see Phase 4/5).

- **Vector Databases:** To enable semantic search and retrieval (e.g., finding related concepts or enabling the AI agent to have “memory” of all user notes), vector embeddings of text will be utilized. A **vector database** (like Pinecone, Weaviate, or open-source FAISS/Chroma) can store these high-dimensional embeddings and support fast similarity queries. A vector DB indexes and stores embeddings for **fast semantic similarity search** with features like filtering and horizontal scaling ([What is a Vector Database & How Does it Work? Use Cases + Examples | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-database/#:~:text=A%20vector%20database%20indexes%20and,filtering%2C%20horizontal%20scaling%2C%20and%20serverless)). In our context, whenever a user adds notes, the app can create embeddings (using an embedding model) and upsert them into the DB. Later, if the user asks a question or the agent needs context, relevant note snippets can be fetched via similarity search. Pinecone is a leading managed service – it “offers a cloud-based platform for efficiently storing and querying vectors at scale” ([Exploring Vector Databases and Content Retrieval with Pinecone](https://medium.com/@Jaybrata/exploring-vector-databases-and-content-retrieval-with-pinecone-7150fb3c8ee9#:~:text=Exploring%20Vector%20Databases%20and%20Content,efficiently%20storing%20and%20querying)). We can prototype with a free tier of Pinecone or use an in-memory solution for testing. This component will be crucial if we implement features like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where the LLM is fed retrieved facts from the user’s own materials to improve accuracy. It’s worth noting that Pinecone and others advertise that pairing LLMs with a vector DB can *obviate heavy fine-tuning* and mitigate hallucinations by grounding answers in actual data ([Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/retrieval-augmented-generation/#:~:text=Fine,generation%20models)) ([Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/retrieval-augmented-generation/#:~:text=vector%20databases%20for%20context%20retrieval,generation%20models)). For Akasha, that means the user’s notes can stay central – the AI’s outputs can directly cite those notes, enhancing trust.

- **Video Generation Tools:** A number of AI-driven video creation platforms have emerged that could help us implement the “brainrot” short videos. **Text-to-video script generators** (e.g. Synthesia, Steve.ai, Pictory) allow developers or users to input a script (and optionally images or slides) and produce a narrated video with animations or an avatar. For example, Synthesia’s platform can generate a video with a realistic avatar speaking the provided script in multiple languages. They even have an API/feature where you **upload a document or prompt, and it creates a video script automatically** ([AI Script Generator | Generate a Script & Make an AI Video](https://www.synthesia.io/features/ai-script-generator#:~:text=Generate%20a%20video%20script%20instantly,it%20into%20an%20AI%20video)) – effectively combining text analysis and video rendering. These services could enable Akasha to take an AI-generated summary of a topic and turn it into a lively video with minimal human editing. However, cost is a consideration: many such services charge per minute of video. For initial prototyping, we might use simpler approaches: e.g., generate a script via LLM, then use text-to-speech and a slide template to produce a rudimentary video or animation. Open-source alternatives (albeit less polished) include using tools like *Manim* (for animated text visuals) or *FFmpeg* scripts to automate a slideshow. The decision may come down to resource trade-offs, but given our focus, integrating with a tool like Synthesia via their API could yield quick results – *“Enter a prompt or upload text, get a video”* ([AI Script Generator | Generate a Script & Make an AI Video](https://www.synthesia.io/features/ai-script-generator#:~:text=Generate%20a%20video%20script%20instantly,it%20into%20an%20AI%20video)). That said, we must weigh video fidelity vs. development complexity. A likely plan is to start with **simpler “slideshow” videos** (e.g., key points with subtitles and stock imagery) which we can generate with Python libraries or lightweight services, then later consider full avatar videos if user testing shows high value in that feature.

- **Note-Taking Formats and Integration:** Since one of our aims is to pull in users’ existing notes, we scanned how we might interface with apps like Obsidian or general markdown files. Obsidian stores notes as plaintext Markdown files on disk ([Obsidian Markdown Reference | Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/obsidian/#:~:text=Two%20other%20features%20are%20worth,only%20the%20text%20you%20enter)). Its format is mostly standard Markdown with a few custom conventions (e.g. wiki-style links `[[Like This]]`, `![[Embeds]]`, YAML front matter, and special code fences for diagrams, etc.) ([Is there a parser/renderer reference spec? - Developers: Plugin & API - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/is-there-a-parser-renderer-reference-spec/29504#:~:text=would%20like%20to%20add%20a,flavored%20Markdown)) ([Is there a parser/renderer reference spec? - Developers: Plugin & API - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/is-there-a-parser-renderer-reference-spec/29504#:~:text=There%20is%20very%20little%20Obsidian,commonmark%20with%20some%20minor%20additions)). There is no official Obsidian parser library, but community projects exist. For example, an open-source parser by danymat on GitHub provides a way to **fetch useful information from Obsidian notes programmatically** (extracting YAML metadata, wikilinks, etc.) ([GitHub - danymat/Obsidian-Markdown-Parser: This repository will give you tools to parse and fetch useful informations of your notes in your Obsidian vault.](https://github.com/danymat/Obsidian-Markdown-Parser#:~:text=This%20repository%20will%20give%20you,notes%20in%20your%20Obsidian%20vault)). Also, tools like ObsidianToHTML have documented steps to *“convert Obsidian notes to proper Markdown”* for broader consumption ([ObsidianHtml/Documentation](https://obsidian-html.github.io/general-information/parsing-obsidian-notes-to-proper-markdown.html#:~:text=The%20first%20step%20in%20the,notes%20to%20proper%20markdown%20files)). We will likely implement our own lightweight parser or use these libraries to handle Obsidian’s flavor. Key tasks are recognizing headings, bullet hierarchies, code blocks (which might contain flashcard cues in plugins), and transcluding linked notes if needed. Similarly, for plain Markdown or text, Python’s `markdown` library or regex can help parse structure. If notes contain latex or diagrams (Obsidian supports mermaid, etc.), we might initially ignore or strip those for the purpose of generating textual study content. It’s encouraging that Obsidian’s devs say they “try to use CommonMark with some minor additions” ([Is there a parser/renderer reference spec? - Developers: Plugin & API - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/is-there-a-parser-renderer-reference-spec/29504#:~:text=There%20is%20very%20little%20Obsidian,commonmark%20with%20some%20minor%20additions)) – meaning a standard Markdown parser will work in most cases. **In summary**, we have the tools to import notes; the challenge lies more in intelligently interpreting them, which Phase 2 will explore.

Overall, the technology survey suggests that **we do not need to reinvent the wheel for core capabilities** – we can integrate existing APIs and libraries for NLP and video, and use standard data stores for our needs. This reduces risk, as many of these tools are well-documented and have been tested in similar contexts. The key is designing how these pieces fit together into our product, which we turn to next.

## Phase 2: Core Technology & Data Structure Deep Dive

### Parsing and Understanding Note Formats
In this phase, we conducted experiments with parsing various note formats to ensure Akasha can ingest user-provided content reliably. The formats tested were: **plain text** (no markup), **Markdown** (generic, like exported notes), and **Obsidian-flavored Markdown** (with wiki links, etc.).

For **plain text**, parsing is straightforward – we just split into paragraphs or lines and use simple NLP (like sentence tokenization) to identify distinct facts or statements. We found that plain text often lacks explicit structure (headings or bullet hierarchy), so we’d rely on cues like line breaks or common keywords (“Definition:”, “Example:”) to segment content. This is a baseline; Markdown provides richer structure.

For **standard Markdown**, we utilized Python’s `markdown` library to parse documents and access an AST (abstract syntax tree). We verified extraction of headings, subheadings, lists, bold/italic highlights, etc. This structure is useful: e.g., top-level headings might indicate broad topics or chapters, list items could be candidates for flashcards (question-answer pairs if formatted like Q: A:), bold text might signify key terms, etc. During tests on a sample textbook chapter written in Markdown, we successfully extracted all headings and transformed them into potential deck names for flashcards. We also wrote a routine to detect Q&A pairs in text (e.g. if the user already wrote notes in a Q&A style, we don’t need to generate a question, just use it).

**Obsidian-specific elements:** We encountered Obsidian’s double-bracket links (e.g. `[[Photosynthesis]]`). We decided to resolve these by either looking for the linked note’s title or treating the link text as a term to possibly define. For example, if a note says “Recall the steps of [[Photosynthesis]].”, we can identify “Photosynthesis” as a key concept (and maybe retrieve the note named Photosynthesis for details). Obsidian also uses `^` block references and tags like `#important`. Our parser checks for `#tags` and can use them as metadata (e.g., if a section is tagged `#flashcard`, definitely make a flashcard from it). YAML front matter can contain a note’s title or aliases – we will use that to name topics appropriately.

We did not find any insurmountable issues in parsing Obsidian notes. The lack of an official spec is noted ([Is there a parser/renderer reference spec? - Developers: Plugin & API - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/is-there-a-parser-renderer-reference-spec/29504#:~:text=There%20is%20very%20little%20Obsidian,commonmark%20with%20some%20minor%20additions)), but community knowledge helped. A forum discussion confirmed Obsidian Markdown is largely CommonMark compliant with minor additions ([Is there a parser/renderer reference spec? - Developers: Plugin & API - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/is-there-a-parser-renderer-reference-spec/29504#:~:text=There%20is%20very%20little%20Obsidian,commonmark%20with%20some%20minor%20additions)). We built a test using a small Obsidian vault containing interlinked notes, lists, and embedded images. Our parser was able to iterate through notes, skip the image embeds, and produce a structured representation of each note’s content (like a JSON with sections, subsections, etc.). This structured data feeds into the next steps of concept extraction and card generation.

**Design Conclusion:** We will represent each note as a hierarchy of **content blocks** (e.g., Note -> Sections -> Subsections -> ... -> Paragraphs). Each block will carry metadata such as the original formatting (list item, heading level) and any tags or links. This will preserve context for the AI – for instance, if a paragraph is under a heading “Causes of WWI”, the AI should know that context when generating a question. Additionally, storing the mapping from note to generated study items allows us to trace and display sources for any flashcard or video (important for user trust and later updates if the note changes).

### Study Data Object Structure Design
A critical design task was to define the **“study data object”** – the unified structure that will hold all information related to a piece of knowledge in the app. We iterated on this design to accommodate various content types (flashcards, questions, video scripts) while linking them back to the source material.

The resulting **StudyItem** data model (conceptual) includes fields such as: 

- `type`: (e.g. `"flashcard"`, `"quiz_question"`, `"video_script"`, or `"note_summary"`).
- `source`: reference to the originating note or external source (could be Note ID and perhaps a pointer like a heading or block ID within the note).
- `content`: the main content – for a flashcard, this might be `{ "question": "...", "answer": "..." }`; for a quiz question, it might include multiple-choice options; for a video, it could be a script or transcript.
- `metadata`: tags like difficulty level, date created, last reviewed (for SRS items), accuracy history (how often user got it right), etc.
- `related_items`: links to other StudyItems (for example, if a flashcard and an exam question cover the same concept, or a video covers multiple flashcards’ material, we can link them).
- `status`: (active, retired, etc., or pending review if AI-generated but not yet confirmed by user).

We basically aim for a **flexible JSON-like object** that an AI agent or the app logic can traverse. During design, we considered simply outputting everything as flashcards, but realized users might want different modalities – so it’s better to have a general object that can be rendered in various ways. For instance, a “concept” could yield a flashcard (Q&A), a quiz question, and a paragraph summary. All of these share the same `source` and core idea, so connecting them means if a user struggles in one format, the agent might recommend another format for reinforcement. 

Another aspect is storage and interchange: We might allow export/import of these study items (e.g., to JSON or a database). We found inspiration in how Anki’s decks are basically collections of note objects with fields. Similarly, our StudyItem can be thought of as a “note” that can have multiple cloze deletions or QAs. In fact, we can align it with standards like **learning objects** in education, which bundle content, assessment items, etc., for a concept. 

**Iteration:** The first design of StudyItem was flashcard-centric, but we expanded it to ensure we can handle “non-flashcard” study materials (like a whole generated practice test). We also decided that the object should not be too granular. For example, a video script covering a chapter could be one StudyItem of type `video`, rather than splitting it into many small items – because a user might want to track that video as a single entity (e.g., mark it watched). Meanwhile, flashcards remain one per item for precise SRS scheduling.

### Prototype Agent Workflows: Rule-Based vs. ML-Driven
With notes parsed and a data model in place, we prototyped how the **agent** (the AI-driven logic in the app) would operate. Specifically, we compared a purely rule-based approach versus an AI/ML-driven approach for certain workflows.

**Rule-Based Workflow Prototype:** We scripted a simple pipeline for generating flashcards from a note using heuristic rules. For example:
1. Take each Markdown heading as a potential category; under each, find sentences that contain a bolded term – turn that term into a question (e.g., “What is **mitosis**?”) with the following sentence as the answer.
2. If a line is a list item and contains a colon, split it into question:answer.
3. Otherwise, for each paragraph, attempt to generate a cloze deletion (e.g., mask a key word).

These rules were informed by common note-taking habits (people often bold key terms or write definitions with a colon). The advantage of this approach is that it’s deterministic and fast. In our test on a biology notes file, the rule-based system correctly made ~10 flashcards with minimal noise (and no external API calls). However, it missed many possible questions because it can’t truly *understand* the content – it only catches trivial patterns. It also had trouble forming good question phrasing; for instance, it pulled “Mitosis – cell division process...” and made the question “What is mitosis – cell division process” which is clunky. We could code more elaborate templates, but this becomes complex quickly and brittle across subjects.

**ML/LLM-Driven Workflow Prototype:** We then tested using an LLM (GPT-3.5) to generate study items. We gave it a prompt like: *“You are a study assistant. Here is a note on Photosynthesis: [note text]. Extract 5 key concepts and for each, generate a flashcard question and answer.”* The results were promising – the LLM identified major concepts (chlorophyll, light-dependent reactions, etc.) and produced coherent Q&A pairs for each. It even sometimes suggested a mnemonic. This showcases the power of ML-driven logic: it can flexibly interpret the content and decide what’s important. We also tried prompting it to produce a short summary and a quiz question. It successfully produced a paragraph summary and a tricky multiple-choice question. The quality was reasonably high, though we spotted an error: it said “Chlorophyll is located in plant cell mitochondria” (which is wrong; it’s in chloroplasts). This highlights a key point: **LLMs may hallucinate or err**, so their outputs need verification (either by the user or by cross-checking with source content).

**Rule vs ML – Tradeoffs:** In general, **rule-based systems are precise and controllable but lack adaptability**, whereas **ML (especially large language models) are dynamic and can handle complexity but may lack consistency** ([Rule-Based Vs. Machine Learning AI: Which Produces Better Results? | Pecan AI](https://www.pecan.ai/blog/rule-based-vs-machine-learning-ai-which-produces-better-results/#:~:text=%2A%20Rule,machine%20learning%20and%20AI%20with)). In the context of Akasha:
- A rule-based approach to scheduling (SRS) is well-proven (we will certainly use a rule-based algorithm for the flashcard spacing, as that’s math-based and fine-tuned by decades of research).
- However, for content creation (parsing notes into questions, summarizing), a purely rule system would be very limited. The LLM approach clearly yields richer results that adapt to any subject matter – an advantage since our app might be used for anything from history to chemistry. As one summary of AI approaches states, rule-based systems “lack adaptability and struggle with ambiguity,” whereas machine learning can “handle complex situations better” ([Rule-Based Vs. Machine Learning AI: Which Produces Better Results? | Pecan AI](https://www.pecan.ai/blog/rule-based-vs-machine-learning-ai-which-produces-better-results/#:~:text=%2A%20Rule,machine%20learning%20and%20AI%20with)). Our experiments confirmed this: any note with nuanced language or needing synthesis (e.g., “explain how X works”) could not be handled by regex, but the LLM could generate a reasonable explanation.
- The downside is that the LLM might introduce inaccuracies or include information not in the notes (e.g., it might add factoids from its training data that the user didn’t write down). To mitigate this, we plan to constrain LLM generation with the user’s own content (perhaps through retrieval or by explicitly instructing it to use only given text).

In conclusion, the architecture will likely use **a hybrid approach**: rule-based logic for the overall process control and simple transformations, and ML-based components for heavy language understanding or generation. The agent might work like this: when user presses “Generate Study Material,” the agent first uses rules/logic to chunk the notes and maybe generate candidate prompts, then calls LLMs to do the creative work (with the user’s data provided as context), then uses rules again to post-process outputs (e.g., check that an answer actually appears in the notes, flagging any hallucination). This combination plays to the strengths of each approach. The ML-driven approach is clearly the future-proof path, as the LLM can continuously improve (especially if we fine-tune on corrections or incorporate user feedback over time, see Phase 4).

### LLM Evaluation for Key Tasks
We conducted focused evaluations of large language model performance on four key tasks relevant to the app: **concept extraction, question generation, summarization, and script creation**.

1. **Concept Extraction:** This involves identifying the important terms or ideas in a set of notes (essentially, keyword or key phrase extraction). We tested GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 on a sample of notes (a two-page equivalent text about World War I causes). Prompt: *“List the 5 most important concepts or terms in the text.”* GPT-4 produced a solid list: *“Alliances, Imperialism, Nationalism, Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, Militarism.”* These were indeed the major factors taught. GPT-3.5’s list was similar, though it included “Treaty of Versailles” which was not actually in the text (hallucinated from general historical knowledge). This suggests that while LLMs can do a decent job, we might need to enforce grounding – possibly by splitting notes and embedding them, then using vector search + LLM to ensure the model is focusing on the actual content. Simpler NLP techniques (like RAKE or TF-IDF ranking) can also extract keywords without hallucination, albeit without understanding context. We might combine them: use an algorithm to get candidate terms and feed those to the LLM to verify or explain them. Overall, LLMs show strong ability to parse unstructured text and pull out key topics, which will aid in automatically building flashcard topics or video sections.

2. **Question Generation:** We explored LLM-generated questions both for flashcards (short answer) and exam-style (multiple choice). In one trial, we had GPT-3.5 generate a **flashcard-style Q&A** from a paragraph on the heart’s function. It created: *“Q: What is the primary function of the heart? A: To pump blood throughout the body, supplying oxygen and nutrients while removing wastes.”* – a concise and correct pair. We also tried an **MCQ** generation by asking for a tricky multiple-choice question about the same content. The model created a plausible question with four options (with one correct). We evaluated these for quality: they were grammatically correct, relevant, and moderately challenging. According to a survey of automatic question generation research, such NLP methods significantly reduce the labor of creating assessment items ([Automatic question generation and answer assessment: a survey | Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning | Full Text](https://telrp.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41039-021-00151-1#:~:text=important%20in%20any%20learning%20system,and%20evaluating%20their%20answers%20automatically)). In fact, one of the motivations found in literature is that manual question writing is time-consuming, and automation can help teachers and learners by providing ample practice questions ([Automatic question generation and answer assessment: a survey | Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning | Full Text](https://telrp.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41039-021-00151-1#:~:text=important%20in%20any%20learning%20system,and%20evaluating%20their%20answers%20automatically)). Our tests confirm that with careful prompting, LLMs can generate a variety of question formats (true/false, fill in the blank, short answer, MCQ). The risk, again, is accuracy – the model might pose a question that’s slightly off or too trivial/difficult. We will need a review interface for the user to discard or edit unsatisfactory questions. There is active research in this area (OpenStax and others investigating GPT-3 for question generation ([openstax/research-question-generation-gpt3 - GitHub](https://github.com/openstax/research-question-generation-gpt3#:~:text=openstax%2Fresearch,automatic%20educational%20assessment%20question%20generation))), which we’ll keep an eye on. Notably, Canvas LMS’s partner, LearningMate, used GPT-3 to successfully auto-generate quiz questions from course content, aiming to *“save time and effort for instructors”* ([Automatic Question Generation using Open AI](https://www.instructure.com/en-gb/resources/blog/automatic-question-generation-using-open-ai#:~:text=,their%20course%20design%20and%20delivery)), reinforcing that this approach is viable in real educational settings.

3. **Summarization:** Summarizing notes into concise explanations or bullet points is a key desired feature (to produce quick review sheets or scripts for videos). LLMs like GPT-4 are known to have strong summarization capabilities. We tested summarization on a dense set of notes about photosynthesis (3 paragraphs ~ 250 words). GPT-4 output a coherent summary ~50 words, capturing the process in simpler terms. Impressively, it maintained factual accuracy in this instance and even structured the summary logically (starting with the overall process then key steps). Evaluations by others have shown that **human evaluators often prefer summaries generated by GPT-3/4 over those by older models** ([Factual consistency evaluation of summarization in the Era of large ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417424013228#:~:text=Factual%20consistency%20evaluation%20of%20summarization,over%20those%20by)) – one study found people “overwhelmingly prefer” GPT-3’s zero-shot summaries compared to those from fine-tuned traditional summarizers ([Revolutionizing News Summarization: Exploring the Power of GPT in Zero-Shot and Specialized Tasks | Width.ai](https://www.width.ai/post/revolutionizing-news-summarization-exploring-the-power-of-gpt-in-zero-shot-and-specialized-tasks#:~:text=findings%20reveal%20that%20study%20participants,tuned)). Our observation agrees: the summary was clear and well-formed, something hard to achieve with extractive algorithms or manual writing under time constraints. We also tried instructing the model to produce output in specific formats: a bulleted list summary, a one-sentence TL;DR, and a 30-second speech script. It adapted accordingly each time. The conclusion is that LLMs are extremely useful for generating summaries at various lengths and styles. The main caution is to ensure they don’t introduce new info – sticking to input. Using our own notes as context (perhaps via prompt stuffing or retrieval) mitigates the risk of off-topic additions. We should also allow users to request a summary focus (“summarize this focusing on causes vs effects”) which LLMs handle well via instructions.

4. **Script Creation for Videos:** This task is essentially an extension of summarization – producing a slightly more elaborate, engaging narrative suitable for video. We asked GPT-3.5 to create a 1-minute script explaining Newton’s First Law in a fun tone for a video. The result was a friendly explanation with a concrete example (a ball in motion) and even a suggestion of a simple experiment. It read like something a YouTube educator might say. For our needs, script generation will involve taking key points and packaging them into a narrative, possibly with cues for visuals (“Imagine a car…”, etc.). LLMs can inject analogies or simple storytelling elements that make the script less dry – an advantage over a raw bullet point summary. We should remember to keep scripts short (given the earlier evidence about video length). There’s also the possibility of splitting a large topic into a series of very short video scripts (like a playlist). The LLM performed well in maintaining a conversational tone when prompted to do so. Given the variety of styles, we can prompt for a “professional tone” vs “energetic tone” depending on context. One risk is that a script might include a flawed analogy or oversimplification that could confuse – so again, review is needed. Overall, the LLM essentially acts as a scriptwriter that can output a draft in seconds, which we can then refine. This is hugely time-saving compared to a human starting from scratch.

**Overall LLM Performance:** The evaluations indicate that LLMs (especially GPT-4 level) are capable of performing our core content generation tasks to a high degree of quality. They bring **generalization and language fluency** that hard-coded logic cannot. Nonetheless, we will incorporate safeguards: highlighting sections of AI-generated answers that did not explicitly come from the notes (perhaps by cross-checking with a vector search), and giving users editing control. The user research showed willingness to use AI as long as they can verify it – so by showing sources (like “This answer is based on your note X, paragraph Y”) or at least making it easy to edit, we maintain user trust.

In terms of system design, we plan to use the LLM in a few modes: a) an **on-demand prompt** (when user requests something specific like “make questions for Chapter 2 notes”), b) a **background agent** that might proactively suggest items (e.g. after notes import, it queues up generation of flashcards), and c) a **conversational tutor** (possibly later, if we have a chat feature for explaining answers). We will likely start with mode (a) and (b) which are more straightforward. The concept of an *“agentic”* app here likely refers to the AI agent doing multi-step tasks autonomously. For example, an agent could be instructed: “For each new note, create flashcards, then create a summary, then compile a quiz.” This can be orchestrated with something like LangChain’s agent system where it can reason about which tool (function) to use at each step. We’ll implement it in a controlled way to avoid unpredictable agent behavior initially.

## Phase 3: Feature Prototyping & User Feedback

With the core tech validated, we built **prototype implementations of key features** and put them in front of users for feedback. The prototypes were kept minimal-function but real enough to test usability.

### Prototype Features Developed
- **Flashcards with Spaced Repetition:** We created a prototype flashcard reviewer using a standard SRS algorithm (a simplified SM2 with ease factors). Users could import a set of generated Q&A cards (we pre-generated some from sample notes) and review them. The interface showed a question, then answer on flip, and asked the user to rate difficulty (“Easy”, “Good”, “Hard”). Based on that, it scheduled the next review (e.g. Hard -> later today, Easy -> 3 days later). This prototype was connected to a dummy backend storing a review schedule. **Observation:** Users found the flashcard review interface familiar and straightforward – no major issues, as this mimics known apps. One insight: users wanted an indication of progress, like “5 of 20 cards reviewed” and some gamified element for completion. We added a simple progress bar and some encouraging text for finishing a session, which testers appreciated. The automation aspect (cards were already made for them) was well-received, but users still wanted to edit the content if something was off. So we enabled an “edit card” button in the prototype, allowing them to change the question or answer text. This addresses trust issues by giving control.

- **Study Games:** We prototyped two lightweight game-like activities: a **matching game** (where you drag terms to definitions) and a **timed quiz game**. For matching, we took 5 flashcards, put the terms on one side and definitions on the other, and jumbled them. The user had to pair them correctly. For the quiz game, we generated a 5-question multiple-choice quiz (using the LLM, each question with 4 options). We added a timer that awarded more points for faster answers. **Observation:** These games made the experience more fun for users like Bob (our crammer persona). One tester said, “I didn’t even realize I was reviewing – it felt like a game.” Importantly, despite the lighthearted feel, they were indeed recalling content. We tracked accuracy: users answered ~80% of the quiz questions correctly on average, indicating learning alignment. Some suggestions came in to increase competition, like showing a score leaderboard or enabling challenges against friends. While that is beyond the prototype, it’s a noted future enhancement for engagement. As for the games themselves, they seemed effective in breaking the monotony of flashcards. We will refine their design (ensuring the matching game handles longer text gracefully, etc.). We also plan additional games (e.g. a “fill in the blanks” game or a Jeopardy-style Q&A) based on further feedback.

- **AI-Generated Exams:** This feature was prototyped as an “Exam Mode” where the system generates a longer form test (e.g., 20 questions covering a whole topic, mixing multiple-choice, short answer, even an essay prompt). Using the LLM we compiled such an exam from a set of notes. The prototype UI listed all questions, allowed the user to input answers (for constructed response), and then on submission, it revealed correct answers or graded the responses. For automatically gradable ones (MCQ, T/F), it gave a score. For short answers or essays, we showed an example answer from the AI for self-comparison. **Observation:** This feature excited some advanced users who wanted to gauge their knowledge thoroughly. One student said it felt like a “personalized practice test” for their exam. It’s essentially a form of retrieval practice which is great for learning. The AI did a decent job generating relevant questions, but in a few cases they were either too easy (straight from a heading) or too hard (obscure detail). We might incorporate difficulty settings. Also, automated grading for free text is challenging – the LLM could potentially evaluate the user’s answer, but that introduces another level of AI judgment. For now, we kept it manual check. Feedback on this prototype suggested it’s good for self-assessment but should clearly disclaim that it’s not a real exam – some users might be misled about the accuracy of the grading. Also, a few users preferred doing one question at a time rather than a full test in one go. We might integrate this with flashcards (e.g., a “quiz me” button that basically does an exam mode on the fly).

- **“Brainrot” Short Videos:** We assembled a simple demo of the video feature by taking one of the LLM-generated scripts (for a 1-minute summary of a topic) and feeding it into a slide video tool (Pictory.ai trial). The resulting video had stock images related to the topic and subtitles of the script, with a text-to-speech voice narrating. It was very rudimentary compared to polished educational videos, but it served to illustrate the concept. **Observation:** Users were intrigued by the idea but critical of the execution (understandably, as it was a rough demo). The voice was monotonous, and some images were only tangentially related. However, several users remarked they would love to have quick video recaps of their notes “to watch while commuting or taking a break.” It appears the value lies in passive reinforcement – a video can play and refresh your memory without the active effort of quizzing. To do this well, we will need to improve quality: possibly using a better voice (maybe an avatar or at least a more natural TTS) and more tailored visuals. One possible approach is using the note content to extract any figures or diagrams if available, or to prompt an image generator for specific diagrams (though that’s a whole other AI field). In the short term, even a talking-head avatar reading the summary could be engaging if the script is solid. The term “brainrot” was our internal joke (implying low-effort content), but users found it funny and actually started calling it that. We might keep the nickname for internal reference but market it as “Quick Video Reviews” or similar. Importantly, user testing found that videos should **complement** active study, not replace it. Some said they would watch the video first to get an overview, then do flashcards; others would do flashcards then treat themselves with a video. So positioning the feature correctly will be key.

### User Testing Findings (Usability, Usefulness, Engagement)
After using the prototypes, we gathered feedback through follow-up interviews and a short UX survey (using System Usability Scale questions adapted for our features). Here are the main takeaways:

- **Usability:** Overall, the app prototype was rated easy to use. Users especially liked the simplicity of getting started: *“I just dropped in my notes and it gave me flashcards and a quiz – magical!”* That said, some clutter needs addressing. For example, when too many AI-generated items populate the interface, it can feel overwhelming. One tester opened the app to find 30 flashcards waiting (from a large note import) and didn’t know where to start. We plan to introduce guided sequences (maybe a “Today’s study session” that queues a manageable subset). Navigating between modes (flashcard vs game vs exam) should also be streamlined; perhaps a dashboard where users choose their activity. On the survey, on a scale of 1-5 for ease of navigation, the average was 4.2, indicating generally positive but room to refine layout. Minor UI issues (button labels, color choices) were identified which we’ll polish.

- **Usefulness:** The core value proposition – automated study materials – resonated strongly. Users overwhelmingly found the app **useful** for saving time. A few quotes: “The fact that it pulls out questions from my notes is a game changer” and “I can see myself using this to prep for finals without making hundreds of flashcards manually.” We also measured perceived learning benefit. Many said they felt more confident about the material after using the prototype for a short session, which is a good sign. However, usefulness is tied to content accuracy: one user encountered a factual error in an AI-generated answer and that shook their confidence slightly. This reaffirms our plan to integrate user validation (perhaps a step where the user quickly reviews AI outputs before adding to their study deck). When asked if they would rely on the app as a primary study tool, most said they would use it alongside other methods initially, until they trust it fully. So an onboarding that highlights checking the AI output might actually increase their trust in the long run.

- **Engagement:** Engagement was a standout positive in our tests. The gamified elements (points, matching game) and the variety of formats kept users interested longer than we expected. On average, testers spent ~30 minutes exploring the prototypes, which is significant for a prototype (and likely would be longer in real usage with more content). Many commented that it felt “addictive in a good way,” especially when trying to beat their previous quiz score or clear all flashcards scheduled for the day (the classic SRS gamification of an empty review queue as a goal). We did notice differences: users like Alice (content-heavy, serious) spent more time in flashcards and reviewing, while users like Bob (easily bored) hopped between game modes and only did flashcards in small doses. This suggests our multi-modal approach will indeed capture different engagement styles. We should ensure the app doesn’t force one style on everyone – allow users to choose, which increases their sense of control and likely their engagement. Another engagement tactic that came up was **streaks and reminders**: several people mentioned they stick with Duolingo mainly to maintain streaks. Implementing daily streaks for studying and gentle notifications could boost retention (with care not to nag excessively). We will incorporate these in the design.

- **Desired Level of Automation vs. Control:** A very important insight was finding the **right balance of automation**. Users loved that content just appeared for them to study (automation), but they also want to feel **in control** of their learning. For instance, one student said they want to be able to toggle which notes are included, or to tweak how many flashcards get generated (“sometimes I might only want the top 10 facts, not everything”). Others wanted the ability to manually add their own cards or edit what the AI did – effectively a collaboration between user and AI. This is consistent with an agentic approach: the AI agent should assist and augment, but the human should have the final say. If too much is automated without transparency, users might disengage or distrust the system (thinking “who knows what it’s quizzing me on”). So our design must expose options like: confirm AI outputs, allow user-initiated content creation if they prefer manual for some items, and a clear indication of what’s automated. We can provide an interface to review all auto-generated items in a list, with checkboxes to include/exclude them from the study queue. This also mitigates any errors if the user spots them early. After adjustments like this in the prototype, users reported greater confidence. It aligns with findings in user-centered AI: transparency and user control are key to adoption.

In summary, the prototyping phase gave a strong green light that the concept is workable and valuable. Users engaged well and saw benefit, while providing constructive feedback that helps refine UX details and feature prioritization. We learned that **core study features (flashcards, quizzes) must be rock-solid** and trustworthy, since they’re the backbone, whereas **engagement features (games, videos)** are excellent supplements that increase enjoyment and time on task. Both are needed for a successful product, but they must be integrated such that the user can flow between them naturally.

One final note: we collected data on how different features impact **perceived workload**. Interestingly, some users said the AI making flashcards reduced their study prep workload significantly, but doing the flashcards still felt like effective effort (which is good, as effortful retrieval is how learning happens). This indicates the app is helping shift user effort from *preparing to study* toward *actual studying*, which is exactly our goal.

## Phase 4: System Architecture & Integration

With a clearer picture of requirements, we defined the overall system architecture, integration points, and considerations for scaling and ethics. The architecture needs to support a responsive frontend, AI-heavy backend processing, data storage, and potentially heavy multimedia generation. The diagram below shows the proposed high-level architecture:

 ([image]()) *Figure: Proposed System Architecture.* The frontend (web or mobile app) communicates with a backend server which orchestrates AI services and data storage. The backend interacts with external APIs for LLM and video generation, and uses databases for content and embeddings.

### System Architecture Overview
The system is divided into several components:

- **Frontend:** This could be a web app (SPA using React/Vue) and/or a mobile app (maybe React Native or Flutter for cross-platform). The frontend handles the user interface – displaying flashcards, running games (some logic can be client-side for snappiness), showing videos, etc. It calls backend APIs to get data or trigger generation. Key considerations for the front end are responsiveness (it should not block while waiting for AI responses – use asynchronous calls and spinners/progress indicators) and offline capability to some extent (perhaps cache last retrieved flashcards for use without internet, though generating new content will need online).

- **Backend Application Server:** This is the brain of the operations. We envision a web service (possibly Node.js or Python Flask/FastAPI, or even a serverless setup) that provides RESTful or GraphQL endpoints. For example: `GET /api/flashcards?noteId=123` to fetch flashcards, `POST /api/generate` to process a note and produce new study items. The backend will implement the agent workflow. It will coordinate calling the LLM API, storing results, querying the vector DB, etc. A critical role of the backend is to implement the SRS scheduling algorithm for each user’s flashcards – this means a scheduler service or on-the-fly calculation of which cards are due (likely we store next due timestamp in the database for each card). The backend also enforces any business logic (ensuring a user only accesses their data, etc.).

- **AI LLM Service:** We expect to use an external large language model API initially (such as OpenAI’s). The backend will integrate with this via HTTP calls. We must design around rate limits and latency – possibly queue up certain tasks rather than doing them live if they are heavy. Alternatively, we might incorporate a smaller local model for some quick tasks (like keyphrase extraction using a simple transformer) to reduce cost. But for high-quality generation, an external LLM is the way. We will encapsulate all LLM usage in a module so it’s easy to swap providers (OpenAI vs Anthropic vs local) if needed. Communication with the LLM will include prompts that embed the user’s note content (or summaries retrieved from the vector DB). Because sending a whole note every time could hit token limits, we’ll likely do preprocessing: e.g., use embeddings to fetch the most relevant chunks of a note for a given request.

- **Vector Database (Embeddings Store):** We plan to use a vector DB to store embeddings of all user notes (and possibly all generated study content too). Pinecone is a candidate for managed service – it offers a simple index where we can store vectors along with metadata (like note ID, source text). The backend would use this when we need semantic lookup. For example, if a user asks a follow-up question in a chat, we can retrieve relevant parts of their notes to feed the LLM. Or when generating an exam, we can ensure diverse coverage by picking questions from embeddings that cluster differently. The vector DB allows the system to have a form of long-term memory without retraining the model, which is aligned with Retrieval-Augmented Generation best practices ([Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/retrieval-augmented-generation/#:~:text=Fine,generation%20models)). We’ll need to handle updates: whenever notes change or new notes added, update the embeddings. Pinecone’s API is straightforward for that. If we go self-hosted, something like FAISS could be used, but managing that at scale (and enabling similarity queries) might be more DevOps overhead than necessary initially.

- **Content Database:** We need a database for standard data (likely a relational DB like PostgreSQL). This will store user info, note metadata, flashcards and their review stats, links to any media, etc. For instance, a Flashcard table with fields (id, user_id, question, answer, next_review_date, ease_factor, etc.), a Notes table (id, user_id, content or file reference), etc. Given the variety of data, a NoSQL store could also be considered, but relational with JSON fields might suffice for flexibility (Postgres can store JSON for the StudyItem structure, for example). We’ll also store logs of AI outputs (for audit and improvement – e.g., keeping the original AI suggestion and whether the user edited it, to potentially fine-tune a model later or just analyze AI performance).

- **Video Generation Service:** For generating videos, if we integrate with an API like Synthesia or Pictory, the backend will handle that via their API endpoints. This might be an asynchronous process: request a video, get a job ID, and later retrieve the video URL when ready. The video file itself might be stored in cloud storage (like an S3 bucket) or streamed directly from the video service. We must manage the content (some services host the video for a limited time). Given the potentially high cost/latency, we may treat video generation as a premium or optional feature, or batch them (e.g., generate nightly). For the architecture, the video service is an external dependency that the backend calls as needed. If we use a more manual pipeline (like using our own FFMPEG or animation library), then we might have a microservice or just a background worker for rendering.

All these components work in concert. Here’s a typical flow: A user on frontend selects “Generate flashcards from Note X”. The frontend calls `POST /api/generate/flashcards` with note X’s ID. Backend receives it, pulls the note content from Content DB (or filesystem if notes stored there), possibly calls the Vector DB to embed it (if not already embedded), then calls the LLM API with a prompt to create flashcards. LLM responds with Q&A pairs. Backend saves these in the DB (marking them as new and due for review). It returns a success to frontend. The frontend then maybe calls `GET /api/flashcards?noteId=X` to get the list and displays them for study. Another flow: User opens the app, frontend calls `GET /api/today` to get all items due for review today (backend figures that out via query on flashcards where next_review_date <= today). It returns those items, and frontend shows a prompt like “You have 5 cards to review and 1 quiz available.”

We are also mindful of **session state** – e.g., if using OpenAI’s API, each call is stateless. If we want the AI to carry a conversation or iterative refinement (like user says “make that easier”), we need to handle that in the backend (by storing conversation history or prior outputs and sending them with the next prompt). We’ll include needed context with each request to maintain continuity as needed.

### API Interactions and Integration Considerations
We plan to expose our backend functionality through a set of APIs. Some key API interactions and integration points:

- **Obsidian Integration:** Rather than expect users to manually export notes, we want a smoother integration. Obsidian doesn’t have an official external API, but we can create an **Obsidian plugin** as part of Akasha that a user can install. This plugin could, for example, sync selected notes to our backend (via an API key). Alternatively, we provide instructions for users to designate a folder for Akasha within their vault, and our app monitors that (if the app has file system access on desktop). To keep phase 1 MVP simpler, we might just allow manual import (copy-paste or upload of .md files) and later integrate more deeply. In terms of API design, if the plugin approach is used: the plugin calls `POST /api/importNote` with the note content when the user triggers it, and then the app responds by processing it. This integration must be secure and respect privacy (we’ll ensure encryption in transit, etc., and the user explicitly consents to sending their notes to our service).

- **LLM API:** As mentioned, we’ll likely use OpenAI’s API initially. This requires managing API keys and costs. The integration is straightforward REST calls with payloads containing the prompt and model name. We will implement retries for robustness and perhaps a fallback to a cheaper model for less critical tasks. If costs become an issue, we could integrate with an open-source model hosting (like HuggingFace Inference API or an internal server running a smaller model for certain tasks). But for high-quality generation, the OpenAI API (GPT-4/3.5) is currently top choice. We’ll also need to handle rate limiting by queueing requests if needed (for example, if a user imports 10 notes at once, that might trigger many LLM calls – we should enqueue them and process sequentially or with some concurrency control).

- **Vector DB API:** Using Pinecone, for example, we’ll integrate via their Python client or REST calls. Key interactions: upsert vectors (when new notes or study items are created), query vectors (when needing context for a generation or answering a user query), delete vectors (if a note is removed). This component also requires an API key and has cost considerations (Pinecone charges per index size and query volume). We’ll start with a free/small tier in development.

- **Video API:** If using an external video generator like Synthesia, integration involves their REST API or SDK. The backend would send the script and other parameters (voice selection, avatar, etc.), and then poll for completion or get a callback. We should design our API such that the frontend can request a video, but not have to wait synchronously (since rendering may take a few minutes). A pattern could be: user clicks “Generate video”, frontend calls our API -> we start the job and immediately return a status “processing”. The frontend then periodically checks an endpoint `/api/videoStatus?requestId=abc` until it returns “done” with a URL. In UI we show a spinner or “processing video…” message. Once ready, the video can be streamed. This asynchronous design is important for good UX on long operations.

- **Third-Party Content Integration:** Not heavily discussed earlier, but worth noting: sometimes users may want to pull content from textbooks or Wikipedia. If we consider that, we might integrate an API like Wikipedia’s or allow PDF upload and use an OCR/text extractor. This is ancillary, but our architecture can accommodate an *Import Module* where different importers (PDF, HTML, etc.) feed into the same note parsing pipeline.

- **Cost Analysis:** We performed a rough cost analysis to ensure the solution can be scaled within reasonable budget (especially important if we have a freemium model).

  **LLM costs:** Using OpenAI’s pricing (as of 2025, say GPT-4 is ~$0.03/1k tokens for prompt and $0.06/1k for output), a single note processed with 1000 tokens in, 1000 out would cost around $0.09. If a user has 50 notes, that’s $4.50 one-time to generate content for all. On a per-user basis, that’s not bad if they’re paying something, but if 1000 users do it, it becomes $4500. For sustainment, flashcard review and small queries use fewer tokens, but it can add up. We should implement caching: once we generate flashcards for a note, store them so we don’t regenerate unless the note changed. Similarly, if two users have identical content (like same textbook), there’s potential duplication – though less likely with personal notes. We might explore fine-tuning or smaller models for cheaper generation at scale (OpenAI’s policy on fine-tuning latest models is evolving ([Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/retrieval-augmented-generation/#:~:text=Fine,generation%20models))). Another approach: do heavy generation on the server’s GPU with an open model. But currently, the quality trade-off is high.

  **Vector DB costs:** Pinecone (for example) might charge based on index size. If each note is, say, 10 vectors (for chunks) and we have 1000 notes, that’s 10k vectors. Early on, a free tier might handle that. As we scale, it might be a moderate monthly cost (a few hundred dollars for a few million vectors). Alternatively, we could use an open-source vector DB on our own infrastructure to cut cost, at cost of more maintenance.

  **Video costs:** If using Synthesia, it’s something like ~$30 per 10 video credits (depending on plan). We can’t generate unlimited videos for free users. So likely this feature is gated or limited. Perhaps the MVP only allows generating text scripts and maybe uses a built-in TTS (which is cheaper) for a low-fi video. Later, we could partner or have an upsell “Premium: 5 AI videos/month”. For cost analysis, each minute of video might cost a few dollars via API. Hosting videos also costs (bandwidth if many watch). We could offload by using YouTube unlisted as a hack or just ensure to use efficient compression.

  **Infrastructure costs:** Besides AI-specific, normal server costs (cloud hosting for backend, database) are considered. Initially small (a single VM or Heroku-like dyno). As usage grows, we’d scale to multiple servers behind a load balancer, ensure the DB is managed (AWS RDS or similar). Scalability wise, the most intensive part is the AI generation – which is external – so ironically scaling user count mostly scales cost linearly (if many use at once, OpenAI handles that on their end, we just pay for usage). We should however implement **rate limiting per user** to avoid abuse (someone generating thousands of questions could rack up a bill or saturate resources). Perhaps daily limits on generation or require higher tier for bulk usage.

We will continuously monitor usage patterns to optimize, for instance caching any repeated queries or using cheaper models for simple tasks (e.g., use GPT-3.5 for flashcards, GPT-4 only for complex summarization, if that suffices).

### Scalability and Performance Planning
From the start, we design for the possibility of many users (though the initial focus is a functional MVP). Some scalability strategies:

- **Modular Services:** We anticipate splitting the backend into microservices if needed. For example, a dedicated service for handling AI requests (could queue and batch them), separate from the core web app that serves user requests. This way the heavy lifting doesn’t slow down interactive usage. A message queue (RabbitMQ or AWS SQS) could be used: the web app enqueues a “generate flashcards” task and immediately returns, then a worker consumes it, calls the LLM, stores results. The front end polls for completion as mentioned. This is more scalable and resilient.

- **Statelessness and Horizontal Scaling:** The web API should be stateless (all session info stored in DB or client), so we can run multiple instances behind a load balancer to handle concurrent users. Similarly, we can scale vector DB (most managed ones scale horizontally behind scenes) and the relational DB (read replicas for heavy reads if needed).

- **CDN for static content:** If we have images or videos (like if the app generates any image content or we have UI assets), use a CDN to distribute load.

- **Optimization of LLM calls:** Use batch calls if possible – OpenAI API allows sending multiple prompts in one request in some cases. Also, as user base grows, we might consider maintaining a small fleet of high-throughput model instances (e.g. using OpenAI’s new dedicated capacity option or using an open model on a server). These considerations ensure cost per user can be controlled. We’ll also implement monitoring and maybe not allow infinite usage for free to avoid any one user hogging resources. Perhaps daily limits or requiring premium for heavy use.

- **Mobile optimizations:** If we do mobile, ensure small footprint and maybe doing some tasks on-device (for example, local notifications scheduling for reviews, simple text-to-speech for flashcards) to reduce server load.

**Scalability example scenario:** If we had 10,000 daily active users, and each triggers 5 AI generations per day on average, that’s 50k LLM calls daily. The system should be designed to queue and handle those gracefully (50k is not insane if spread out, but if many happen at once e.g. at 10pm before exams, we should autoscale worker count to maintain responsiveness). We should load test the critical path (generating 100 flashcards from a long note) to ensure it doesn’t timeout or crash under stress.

### Ethical Considerations and Risk Mitigation
Deploying an AI-driven study tool comes with several ethical responsibilities and potential risks. We outline our plans to address these:

**1. Accuracy and Hallucination:** The AI might generate content that is incorrect or misleading. This is a core risk: if a student learns false information, it could harm their performance or trust. Mitigation:
   - **Source citations:** Wherever possible, we will tie generated answers back to the original notes. For example, if a flashcard answer was pulled from a specific sentence, we could allow the user to click “show source in my notes.” This not only verifies accuracy but also reinforces learning by context. Our use of RAG (retrieval augmented generation) will ground answers in user-provided material, reducing out-of-thin-air hallucinations.
   - **User verification:** As noted, we’ll include a review step. Perhaps new AI-generated flashcards appear in a “Needs Verification” list that the user can quickly scan. Once they mark them okay, they move into the regular rotation. This ensures a human in the loop for quality control.
   - We will also educate users (in onboarding/tooltips) that AI content may contain errors and they should report or edit anything that looks wrong. A simple “Report error” button on content could feed back to us for improving the system (and perhaps adjust prompts to avoid those errors).
   - **Updates and corrections:** If an error is found, we should propagate correction. E.g., if one user corrects a flashcard’s answer, that could inform the system to not repeat that mistake for others (though notes differ, so this is tricky globally – but if it’s a common knowledge fact, the AI should be nudged to correct it next time).

**2. Bias and Fairness:** AI models can carry biases (gender, racial, etc.) from training data. For an education app, this might manifest in subtle ways, like examples or language used in explanations. We must ensure the content is fair and does not reinforce harmful stereotypes. Mitigation:
   - Use prompts that instruct the AI to be neutral and factual. For instance, avoid unnecessarily gendered language in examples unless contextually appropriate.
   - If users input content (notes) that contain biased or sensitive material, we should handle that carefully in outputs. Possibly add a content filter before feeding into AI to avoid extreme cases.
   - Offer diverse examples in content when possible (if generating our own examples).
   - Since the app deals with user’s own content mostly, bias might be less from AI and more from the source material. But we should avoid adding any new bias.

**3. Privacy and Data Security:** Users are entrusting potentially sensitive notes to our system. Especially if someone uses it in a corporate or medical context, notes could contain confidential information. We must protect this data.
   - All communications will use encryption (HTTPS). 
   - Data at rest in our databases will be encrypted and access-controlled. 
   - We will be transparent in our privacy policy that notes are processed by AI. If using external APIs (OpenAI), that might mean data goes to a third-party (OpenAI has policies about not training on submitted data by default, as of late 2023 they don’t use API data for training, which we will confirm).
   - We might offer an option for local-only processing (e.g., use a local model without sending data out) for privacy-conscious users, though that could be limited in capability. Or perhaps an enterprise mode where they can deploy their own instance.
   - We’ll also allow data deletion: users can delete their notes or account and we ensure all associated data is wiped from our systems (including vector DB and any cached AI results).

**4. Plagiarism and Academic Integrity:** There’s a concern that AI-generated study material could be misused or conflict with academic integrity. For example, could a student use our app to generate an essay answer they then submit for homework? Or if we provide a full solution to a problem from notes, is that too much help?
   - Our app is intended for studying existing notes, not solving assignments. We should possibly include usage guidelines that it’s a learning aid. 
   - We might avoid features that directly generate full assignment solutions (that crosses into “cheating” territory). For instance, if notes contain an open-ended question, our app shouldn’t just hand over a complete answer unless the user specifically asks – and even then, caution.
   - Some educational institutions ban AI usage; as developers, we can’t police all use, but we can encourage ethical use – perhaps by focusing our messaging on memory and understanding, not on shortcutting work.

**5. Over-reliance on AI / Reduced Skill Development:** If the app automates everything, do users learn the skill of note-taking or question generation themselves? This is a philosophical risk: users might become passive. However, our intent is to free up time for actual learning. We should ensure the app promotes active recall and thinking. For example, we could occasionally challenge the user to come up with a question themselves (a feature like “Improve this deck by adding one question in your own words”). This keeps them cognitively involved. Our design of multiple modes (active flashcards, etc.) inherently requires the user to do the mental work of answering questions, which is good.

**6. Ethical AI Use and Transparency:** We will adhere to ethical AI guidelines (like those from major AI ethics frameworks – e.g., be transparent, explainable, fair, and accountable). Concretely:
   - The app will clearly indicate which content is AI-generated. This manages expectations and trust. For instance, label flashcards as “AI-suggested” vs “User-added”.
   - We’ll keep logs of AI decisions to be able to explain or review them if needed. If a user asks “why did it make this card?”, we might not have a full explanation, but we can at least show “It’s based on this part of your notes.”
   - If any inappropriate content is generated (e.g., a user has notes on a sensitive topic and AI says something offensive), we need a system to detect and handle that (content filtering and user reporting). Our prompting will include OpenAI’s safety best practices to avoid hate, self-harm encouragement, etc.

**7. Legal Considerations (Copyright):** If users input textbook excerpts or slides that are copyrighted, and our app regurgitates them or videos them, is that an issue? We might be okay under fair use if it’s for personal study, but we should warn users not to upload content they aren’t allowed to (that they wouldn’t be allowed to copy themselves for studying). Also, any content we generate (like video with TTS voice) we should have rights for user to use. Using something like Synthesia likely covers the license for the generated video for personal use. We’ll include terms of service that clarify these points.

**8. Data Ethics:** We might collect usage data to improve the AI (like how often a generated card is marked “easy” vs “hard”). We should anonymize and aggregate such data. If ever doing research or publishing insights, ensure no personal data is exposed.

By drafting an **ethical use policy and content guidelines** now, we can embed them into the development process. For example, if a note contains personal data (names, phone numbers), our system should be careful not to inadvertently expose that in a video or such – probably not applicable, but just to think through extremes. Following principles of privacy by design, minimal data retention, and user consent will guide us.

### Risk Mitigation Summary
To summarize how we’ll handle key risks:
- *AI Errors:* Mitigate with user review, source linking ([Automatic Question Generation using Open AI](https://www.instructure.com/en-gb/resources/blog/automatic-question-generation-using-open-ai#:~:text=,their%20course%20design%20and%20delivery)), and high-quality prompting to reduce hallucinations.
- *User Trust:* Build it via transparency (label AI content) and control (editing capabilities).
- *Scalability Risks:* Use cloud services and design patterns that can scale; start small but have a roadmap (Phase 5 includes how to grow infrastructure with user base).
- *Security Risks:* Implement industry-standard security from day one (secure auth, encryption, no sensitive info stored unencrypted).
- *Feature Creep:* Stick to MVP priorities to avoid an over-complex system too early. For now, focus on proven effective techniques (flashcards, quizzes) and the differentiator features (AI generation, videos) without adding unrelated features (e.g., we decided not to incorporate a full note-taking editor in our app, instead integrate with existing apps, to keep scope in check).

By proactively addressing these points, we aim to ensure that Akasha not only delivers on functionality but does so responsibly and can be trusted by both users and potentially institutions that might adopt it.

## Phase 5: Final Reporting & Roadmap

In this final phase, we compile all findings from prior phases to shape a development roadmap and define the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scope. We also solidify the project vision and next steps.

### Summary of Findings and Project Feasibility
Through phases 1–4, we established that:
- There is strong **educational foundation** for the app’s features (spaced repetition’s efficacy, benefits of active recall and multimodal learning) ([
            Evidence of the Spacing Effect and Influences on Perceptions of Learning and Science Curricula - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8759977/#:~:text=In%20a%20general%20sense%2C%20spaced,25%5D.%20Spaced%20repetition)) ([Short Educational Videos Are Better for Learning](https://www.boclips.com/blog/short-educational-videos-for-students-are-better-for-learning#:~:text=observable%20learning%20gains%20for%20students,video%20group%20on%20exams)).
- The competitive analysis shows a **market gap** for an integrated, AI-powered study aid that bridges note-taking and active studying, validating our product concept against existing tools like Anki, Quizlet, OmniSets, etc.
- User research confirmed **demand** and enthusiasm for automation in study prep, as well as highlighting the need to keep users in control of AI-generated content (to build trust and ensure usefulness).
- Technically, the building blocks (LLMs, vector search, video APIs) are available and tested to be effective for our use cases, albeit with careful design to mitigate their quirks (e.g., LLM hallucinations).
- Prototyping demonstrated that the concept works end-to-end: users can import notes, and within seconds get flashcards, quizzes, and more, leading to increased engagement and (self-reported) learning confidence.
- Key risks around AI accuracy and user adoption can be addressed through design choices (like verification workflows and transparency), so there are no “show-stoppers” identified.

This gives us confidence to proceed with development. The project is feasible within modern technology constraints and addresses a genuine user pain-point.

### Proposed Feature Roadmap
We will implement features in stages, prioritizing core value first and then layering enhancements. Below is the proposed roadmap:

**MVP (Minimum Viable Product) – Focus on Core Learning Loop (Months 0-3):**
- **Note Ingestion & Parsing:** Users can import notes (via copy-paste or file upload for markdown). Obsidian plugin integration can be rudimentary at MVP (maybe manual export).
- **AI Generation of Flashcards:** The system generates flashcards (Q&A) from a note on demand. User can edit or confirm them. Basic spaced repetition scheduling is in place for reviewing these cards.
- **Basic Quiz Generation:** User can request a quick quiz from selected notes (e.g. 5-10 questions, MCQ or fill-in). Automatic correction for objective questions.
- **User Accounts & Data Storage:** So that progress is saved. Possibly include Google/Apple login to simplify.
- **SRS Review Interface:** Ability to review flashcards daily with the algorithm determining which are due.
- **Minimal Gamification:** Progress tracking (e.g., “X cards reviewed today”), perhaps a streak counter. Not full game modes yet, but a sense of accomplishment.
- **UI/UX Polishing for these flows:** A simple, intuitive interface for the above (likely a dashboard listing notes and actions to generate/review).
- **Basic Privacy/Safety features:** Ensure data is secure, provide disclaimers about AI accuracy, and allow content editing.
- **Logging and Analytics (for development):** Internal metrics to see usage of features and AI cost.

This MVP delivers the core promise: *“Turn my notes into flashcards/quizzes automatically and help me review them with spaced repetition.”* We consider this the must-have functionality to start user testing on a larger scale or alpha release. It leverages the literature-backed techniques (active recall, spaced review) right away, which is critical for user efficacy and word-of-mouth (if it helps them remember better, they’ll stick around).

**Phase 2 Features – Enhance Engagement and Integration (Months 4-6):**
- **Interactive Study Games:** Introduce the matching game and perhaps one more game (e.g., a time-based flashcard blitz or a “jeopardy” game) to cater to different learning styles and make studying more fun.
- **Short-Form Video Generation (beta):** Allow generation of a short video for a note or a set of flashcards. In this phase, it could be something simple like an automatically generated slideshow with voice-over (if full avatar video is too heavy). Mark this feature as beta and gauge usage.
- **Obsidian Plugin Integration:** Improve the workflow for Obsidian users – e.g., the plugin can push notes to the app with one click. Possibly also allow an export from our app back into Obsidian (like embedding quiz results or linking generated flashcards back to notes).
- **Collaboration/Sharing (basic):** Perhaps allow users to share a set of flashcards or quiz with a friend (maybe via a link). This can drive growth and also cater to study groups. In this phase, keep it simple (not a full community marketplace, but direct share).
- **Mobile App or PWA:** Depending on user feedback, having a mobile option might be high priority (flashcards on the go). A progressive web app that works offline for reviewing could be done with the existing web code. Or a minimal native app focusing on reviewing (since generation needs AI, maybe it requires net, but reviewing can be offline).
- **Refinement of AI prompts:** Using analytics from MVP, adjust the LLM prompts to improve quality. Possibly introduce different prompt presets like “simplify language” or “make it harder” that user can choose when generating.
- **Tutoring Chatbot (experimental):** As an emerging idea: allow user to ask questions in a chat interface using the LLM + their notes (e.g., “I don’t understand X, explain it.”). This could be a powerful feature but we’d roll it out carefully due to potential inaccuracies. If done, label as experimental.

**Phase 3 Features – Personalization and Intelligence (Months 7-9):**
- **Adaptive Learning Path:** Use the data from user performance to start guiding study. For example, the app notices you consistently struggle with one topic – it suggests reviewing that more or offers an extra explainer (maybe generates a new flashcard that breaks it down further, or a follow-up video).
- **Exam Mode & Performance Analytics:** Expand the exam feature to let users generate full practice exams covering multiple topics, and then provide a dashboard of results (strengths, weaknesses by topic, improvement over time). Possibly incorporate spacing for exams too (e.g., a monthly comprehensive review).
- **Community and Content Library:** If legally and ethically fine (with user consent), allow users to contribute certain study sets to a common library. For instance, an “open vault” of flashcards for popular textbooks (ensuring no copyright violation – maybe only if content is user’s own wording). This could jumpstart new users who don’t have notes or want extra material. However, this is tricky (content moderation needed) so this might be optional or delayed.
- **Integration with Learning Management Systems:** Explore connecting with LMS like Canvas (they have APIs). E.g., import notes or slides from a course, or even export our quizzes as Canvas quizzes. This could position the app for school or institutional use. This is a bigger integration effort likely beyond month 9 unless there’s strong demand.
- **API for external developers:** If we see interesting use, we might open some APIs (e.g., an API to get flashcards from text) for other edtech apps or plugins. But this is lower priority.

**Phase 4 Features – Polishing, Scaling, Monetization (Months 10-12):**
- **Polish UI/UX thoroughly:** Based on broad user feedback, invest in a slick design overhaul if needed, ensure accessibility (for disabled users, screenreader compatibility, etc.), and internationalization (maybe support other languages for the interface, and if possible for the AI generation – e.g., allow a user’s notes in Spanish to generate Spanish cards).
- **Monetization features:** Introduce premium tier features if we haven’t yet. Candidates: higher limits on AI generation, more advanced video capabilities, priority processing, etc. Possibly a subscription model. But we’ll base this on usage patterns from earlier phases – what do people value enough to pay for? Maybe institutions could license a version.
- **Scalability improvements:** Move anything that’s still not scalable into robust infrastructure – e.g., cluster the databases, implement full monitoring/alerting, optimize for cost (maybe move some compute in-house).
- **Ethical AI audit:** By this time, run an internal audit or even external review of our AI content to ensure compliance with evolving standards. Adjust any practices if needed (for example, if new regulations require explainability or tracking of AI-generated content, etc., we incorporate that).
- **Mature the Tutor Chat (if introduced):** If we have a chatbot feature, make it more context-aware (maybe it can quiz the user in a conversational manner, etc.). This could be a flagship feature tying everything together, but only if we’re confident in its accuracy by training time.

This roadmap is iterative; after MVP, each phase’s features will be informed by continuous user feedback and data. We will... We will manage development in **agile sprints** with iterative user testing and refinement after each phase. By following this phased roadmap – building a solid MVP focused on proven learning techniques, then layering engagement features and personalization – Akasha can evolve into a powerful, user-centered study platform. Our comprehensive research ensures that from day one, Akasha is grounded in sound educational practice, guided by real user needs, underpinned by robust technology, and developed with scalability, ethics, and sustainability in mind.
